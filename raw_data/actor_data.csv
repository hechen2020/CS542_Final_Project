Directors,Descriptions
Ryan Gosling,"Before becoming one of the most bankable romantic leads of his generation, Ryan Gosling established himself with misfit outsider roles in award-winning independent films like ""The Believer"" (2001), ""Half Nelson"" (2006) and ""Lars and the Real Girl"" (2007), with a believability that could only come from someone who had struggled with unease and dissatisfaction in their own life. Perhaps his awkward professional start in ill-suited endeavors like a stint as a cast member on the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" (Disney Channel, 1988-1995) and the short-lived fantasy series ""Young Hercules"" (Fox, 1998-99) also provided fodder for the disaffected roles the young actor would later craft with such voracity. Turns in higher-profile romantic dramas such as ""The Notebook"" (2004), combined with much publicized relationships with co-stars like Rachel McAdams brought Gosling a certain amount of heartthrob celebrity, although the actor doggedly avoided the ""Hollywood Star"" persona. After a brief absence from the screen in the late 2000s, Gosling reappeared at decade's end with two hard to classify performances - first, in the fact-based murder mystery ""All Good Things"" (2010), then in the romantic drama ""Blue Valentine"" (2010), the latter of which was a small, independent labor of love that earned him critical raves. With his stoic performance as an unnamed antihero in the neo-noir ""Drive"" (2011), Gosling had firmly established himself as one Hollywood's most interesting and unpredictable rising actors. Moving with ease from moody dramas like ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2012) and the knockabout comedy of '70s-set action flick ""The Nice Guys"" (2016) to the old-school Hollywood glamour of romantic musical ""La La Land"" (2016) and gritty, philosophical science fiction with ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), Ryan Gosling seemingly could do anything and do it brilliantly."
Emma Stone,"American actress Emma Stone broke out of her early teen comedy roles to become one of the most celebrated actors of her generation. A native of Scottsdale, Arizona, she began acting as a child in local theater productions around Phoenix. She moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to pursue acting full time and was cast as Laurie Partridge in ""The New Partridge Family"" (VH1, 2004), a failed reboot of the popular 1970s show. Guest roles in TV series such as ""Malcolm in the Middle"" (Fox, 2000-06) and ""Medium"" (NBC, 2005-11) followed before a supporting role in a raunchy comedy put her on the map. Playing cool girl Jules opposite Michael Cera and Jonah Hill in ""Superbad"" (2007), the actress made a strong impression with the relatively small role. She was soon cast as one of the leads in the short-lived action series ""Drive"" (Fox, 2007). The film roles started becoming bigger, including starring opposite Anna Faris in ""The House Bunny"" (2008) and joining Woody Harrelson, Abigail Breslin, and Jesse Eisenberg in the surprise hit ""Zombieland"" (2009) as post-apocalyptic con artist Wichita. The actress stepped up to carrying a film when she starred in Will Gluck's teen comedy ""Easy A"" (2010), playing a high school girl caught up in a series of rumors run rampant. After supporting roles in ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" (2011) and ""Friends With Benefits"" (2011), she jumped into prestige fare with a starring role in ""The Help"" (2011) as aspiring writer Skeeter Phelan. The film was a critical and commercial success and put Stone on a new, more adult, trajectory. The actress joined a long list of Woody Allen muses when she starred in the director's ""Magic in the Moonlight"" (2014) and ""Irrational Man"" (2015). She also became part of the popular superhero genre with her role as Gwen Stacy in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012) and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (2014) with Andrew Garfield playing the web-slinger. The actress earned her first Academy Award nomination with her role as Michael Keaton's disaffected daughter in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Oscar-winner ""Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" (2014). Her role opposite Ryan Gosling, her costar in ""Crazy, Stupid Love,"" in Damien Chazelle's acclaimed musical ""La La Land"" (2016) cemented her status as an A-list actress. Displaying her musical talents as aspiring actress Mia, she won the Oscar for Best Actress. She continued her strong run, earning critical acclaim for playing real-life tennis star and LGBTQ icon Billie Jean King in ""Battle of the Sexes"" (2017) with Steve Carell. She next joined Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz in the period drama ""The Favourite"" (2018). Her role as scheming lady-in-waiting Abigail Masham scored the actress another Oscar nomination. Despite the critical acclaim, Stone gained a reputation for not taking herself too seriously, making self-effacing appearances on talk shows and the sketch comedy mainstay ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ). In between film roles, she joined former co-star Jonah Hill for the drama series ""Maniac"" (Netflix, 2018), playing a troubled young woman participating in an experimental drug trial. She returned to one of her earliest successes when she reteamed with Eisenberg, Breslin, and Harrelson for the sequel ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" (2019). That same year, it was announced that Stone would star in ""Cruella"" (2021), a live action continuation of the story of Disney villain Cruella de Vil."
John Legend,"John Legend's brand of classy, soulful and politically-engaged music filled a niche on the contemporary R&B scene, beginning with his critically successful debut album Get Lifted (2004). The album marked the first time that mainstream music lovers heard Legend's smooth vocals bringing a certain suavity to hip-hop soul, most notably in the hit single ""Ordinary People."" Legend's sophomore release, Once Again (2006), exceeded the commercial and critical success that he enjoyed with his first album. Instead of shooting for a blend of soul, pop, and hip-hop as he did in his first release, the Grammy Award-winning singer headed for a more innovative, adult contemporary direction on Once Again, which featured the catchy mid-tempo ""Save Room"" and the rock-laced song ""Stereo."" Legend showcased his political convictions and maturing sound on albums such as Wake Up! (2010), a collaboration with hip-hop group The Roots and a solid effort from an undeniably versatile musician and vocal powerhouse. This social conscience led to Legend's greatest success, co-writing the Academy Award-winning ""Glory"" with rapper Common for the soundtrack to the civil rights drama ""Selma (2014). He was born John Stephens on Dec. 28, 1978 in Springfield, OH. At an early age, Legend started playing gospel and classical piano under the tutelage of his grandmother. He attended Springfield North High School, where he graduated as salutatorian at age 16, before going off to attend the University of Pennsylvania as an English major. While in college, Legend put in time honing his budding music career by recording CDs with an a capella group, performing solo at various talent shows and open mic nights, and working as the music and choir director at Bethel A.M.E. Church in Scranton. It was during this time when Legend met hip-hop and R&B artist Lauryn Hill, who gave him his first big break by asking him to play the piano on her hit single ""Everything is Everything"" (1998). Helping his exposer, he was also making the rounds on the nightclub circuit in New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Legend was performing as an independent artist and distributing both his self-titled demo album (2000) and Live At Jimmy's Uptown (2001) when he was introduced by his college roommate to the then-emerging hip-hop artist Kanye West, who signed Legend as the first artist on his Getting Out Our Dreams (G.O.O.D.) label. In 2004, Legend released his official debut album Get Lifted to critical acclaim, thanks in part to the hit single ""Ordinary People,"" a song which he originally wrote for the Black Eyed Peas. The LP went on to win three Grammy Awards in 2006 for Best R&B Album, Best R&B Male Vocal Performance, and the coveted Best New Artist honor. On Legend's sophomore release, Once Again, he collaborated with a stable of talented producers including West and Peas' frontman, will.i.am, to produce another critically-lauded, ballad-driven album with a more adult contemporary sound, evidenced with songs such as the mid-tempo, piano-based love ballad ""Save Room"" and the Grammy Award-winning track ""Heaven (Only Knows). It also featured one of Legend's more upbeat tracks, ""PDA (We Just Don't Care), about public displays of affection. While Once Again lifted Legend's career to new heights, it also made the singer the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit in 2011. Songwriter Anthony Stokes alleged that Legend's song ""Maxine's Interlude"" was based on a demo track that he gave Legend following the singer's concert in 2004. Stokes claimed that he never heard back from Legend after he gave him the track and was taken aback after hearing Legend's single ""Maxine's Interlude"" on the Once Again album. In between song recordings, concert tours and live performances, Legend also dabbled in acting, guest starring on the musical drama series ""American Dreams"" (NBC, 2002-05), where he portrayed Stevie Wonder, and on the HBO comedy series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (2000-2011) as himself. He also collaborated with established artists over the years, including West, Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Fergie, and Pink. For his next major release, Legend and hip-hop/neo soul band The Roots teamed up to record Wake Up!, a politically-profound R&B album where they covered songs pulled from '60s and '70s soulful music such as Marvin Gaye's ""Wholy Holy"" (1971) and Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes' ""Wake Up Everybody"" (1975). It also featured Legend's original composition, ""Shine,"" which was included on the soundtrack to the educational reform documentary ""Waiting for 'Superman'"" (2010). In 2011, Legend announced his engagement to American model Chrissy Teigen, whom he had begun dating in 2007. That same year, the singer's hit song ""Save Room"" was included on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" starring Ryan Gosling and Steve Carrell. In 2012, Legend landed a regular television gig on ""Duets"" (ABC, 2012), a reality competition show where seasoned artists mentored, judged, and performed with aspiring singers, all of whom were competing for a recording contract. The following year, Legend released his fourth album, Love in the Future, which featured the hit single ""All of Me."" Legend teamed with rapper Common to write the song ""Glory"" for the soundtrack to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. biopic ""Selma"" (2014); the collaboration won Best Original Song at the 2015 Academy Awards. Legend followed with the album Darkness and Light (2016) and continued his work in film, co-starring in and providing music for the romantic musical ""La La Land"" (2016) and duetting on the theme song of the live-action ""Beauty and the Beast"" (2017) with Ariana Grande. The following year, Legend starred in the title role of a live concert production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" (NBC 2018) that aired on Easter Sunday."
Rosemarie DeWitt,"A dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker, actress Rosemarie DeWitt made a steady transition from dreaming about acting to making a name for herself in the city's vibrant theater industry. Following years of increasingly larger roles on the stage and on the small screen, it was an unusual family connection that provided her first major break into feature films. As the great granddaughter of the film's subject, boxer James J. Braddock, DeWitt landed a plum role in Ron Howard's Depression-era bio, ""Cinderella Man"" (2005).

From there, she delivered a capable turn in ""The Company Men"" (2010) and spent three seasons as Toni Collette's self-absorbed sister on the critically acclaimed comedy ""The United States of Tara"" (Showtime, 2009-2011). By the time she garnered more praise for the indie film ""Your Sister's Sister"" (2012), DeWitt was well-established as a skilled actress capable of turning in quality performances in any role she chose."
J.K. Simmons,"With an uncanny ability to go from understated to over-the-top, seemingly with the flip of a switch, actor J.K. Simmons became an ever-present fixture in film and on television via a tireless work ethic and nuanced performances. Although his early interest was primarily in musical composition, Simmons made a name for himself in the theater, not only as a vocalist, but as an actor of merit. After a run of shows on Broadway and in touring productions, Simmons began making small appearances in films like ""The Ref"" (1994) and ""The Scout"" (1994). The talented actor was also landing parts on various television series, most notably two recurring, diametrically-opposed characters appearing simultaneously on two different shows. On the brutal prison drama ""OZ"" (HBO, 1997-2003), Simmons played a white supremacist with frightening authenticity, while on ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010) he was the embodiment of empathy and rationality as state psychiatrist Dr. Emil Skoda. Steadily gaining prominence in a variety of feature film work, Simmons landed the plum role of cantankerous tabloid editor J. Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" (2002), earning high marks from legions of comic book fans. In addition to reprising the part for ""Spider-Man"" sequels, Simmons was seemingly everywhere, popping up in the features ""Thank You for Smoking"" (2006), ""Juno"" (2007) and ""Burn After Reading"" (2008). Transcending the category of character actor, Simmons became a welcome addition to any cast, ensuring a performance that was often affecting, frequently surprising, and always memorable. He unexpectedly made the move to mainstream star when his powerful performance in the drama ""Whiplash"" (2014) won him Best Supporting Actor awards at both the Golden Globes and the Oscars.

Sharon Van Etten,"Sharon Van Etten came along as a fresh new voice in the indie-folk genre who developed a strong following the old-fashioned way, through regularly releasing great albums and constantly touring. Van Etten was born on February 26, 1981 in Clinton, New Jersey, as the middle of five kids, with an older brother, a younger brother, and two sisters. The family had a big LP collection that Sharon would plunder and enjoy, and she also sang in choir, and played clarinet, violin and piano. Van Etten started taking singing more seriously in high school. She taught herself how to play guitar, and learned how to craft harmonies by singing in her school choir. Van Etten went to college at Middle Tennessee State University, studied recording, and dropped out, going to work at the Red Rose, a combination coffee shop, record store, and music venue in Nashville. She didn't perform for five years because her boyfriend didn't think she had any talent, but she finally left him and went back home to New Jersey. Finally settling in Brooklyn, Van Etten sold hand-designed CDs on her website, and learned the ropes of the music business working as a publicist at the indie label Ba Da Bing Records. Van Etten's music was discovered by Kyp Malone from the art rock band TV on the Radio, and his brother Colin started playing it on NPR's music podcast All Songs Considered. Her music also got a lot of play on freeform radio powerhouse WFMU by Jeffrey Davison, a DJ who later became a close friend and collaborator. Van Etten's first album, Because I Was in Love, came out on May 26, 2009. Her second album, the ironically titled Epic came out in 2010. Both albums were critically well-received but sold little. By contrast, her third album Tramp (2012), went to number 75 on the Billboard charts. The follow up, Are We There (2014) garnered the best reviews and strongest sales of her career to date, including a four-star review in Rolling Stone and a high 8.2 rating from the influential online review site Pitchfork."

Chris Pratt,"Though audiences the world over knew him for his roles in blockbusters like ""Jurassic World"" (2015) and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), many of Chris Pratt's biggest fans discovered him in his role as Andy Dwyer on the beloved sitcom ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-2015). Born in Virginia, Minnesota in 1979 and raised in Lake Stevens, Washington, Pratt was active in high school wrestling. Though he exuded confidence and was known to proclaim that he would one day be rich and famous, his path to acting was circuitous. He enrolled briefly at community college and later lived for a time in his van in Maui, Hawaii. Though he participated in dinner theater, Pratt only later pursued a full time acting career upon moving to Los Angeles. He was working as a server at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in 2000 when he happened to meet Rae Dawn Chong, who cast him in her directorial debut, the short film ""Cursed Part 3"" (2000). Two years later, Pratt was cast as Bright Abbott on the drama series ""Everwood"" (WB, 2002-06), a part he stuck with until the show wrapped in 2006. He next played the character Che for two years on the series ""The O.C."" (WB, 2003-07) before appearing in the comedy ""Take Me Home Tonight"" (2007). Pratt met actor Anna Faris during filming, and the two were married in 2009, the same year Pratt appeared in the acclaimed sports drama ""Moneyball"" (2009) and joined the cast of  ""Parks and Recreation."" Pratt continued with the show even as his fame in movies climbed. He appeared in Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012) in 2012, and joined the Marvel universe in 2014 taking on the role of Peter ""Star Lord"" Quill in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). Now a legitimate movie star, moved on to star in the latter-day sequel ""Jurassic World"" (2015) as dinosaur trainer Owen before appearing in the science fiction drama ""Passengers"" (2016) and Antoine Fuqua's remake of the Western ""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016). He reprised the role of Peter Quill for ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017) and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), and then reprised the role of Owen for ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" (2018). Pratt and Faris divorced in 2018, but Pratt soon began seeing Katherine Schwarzenegger. The pair married in 2019, the same year Pratt played Peter Quill once again in the smash hit ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019)."
Julia Louis-Dreyfus,"Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus enjoyed an extraordinary run of success on television for more than two decades, first as one of the stars of ""Seinfeld"" (NBC, 1989-1998) and later as the multi-Emmy-winner lead in the acclaimed comedies ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" (CBS, 2006-2010) and ""Veep"" (HBO, 2011-19). Born Julia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus on January 13, 1961 in the New York borough of Manhattan, she was the daughter of writer Judith LeFever and French-born Gérard Louis-Dreyfus, chairman of Louis Dreyfus Energy Services. Her parents divorced a year after her birth, and when Louis-Dreyfus was eight, her mother relocated to Washington, D.C where she married L. Thompson Bowles, dean of the George Washington University Medical School. Bowles' work with Project HOPE took him and his family to various corners of the globe, providing Louis-Dreyfus with a childhood filled with international travel. But she remained in the United States long enough to graduate from the Holton-Arms School, which she followed with theater and performance studies at Northwestern University. While there, she also performed with the Waa-Mu (later Mee-Ow) Show, an improvisational comedy troupe that also counted fellow ""Saturday Night Live"" alums Seth Meyers and Ana Gasteyer among its former members. She also appeared with Chicago's famed Second City improv group, as well as the Practical Theatre Company, an improv group founded by fellow Northwestern student Brad Hall. The group's 1982 show, ""The Golden 50th Anniversary Jubilee,"" caught the attention of ""Saturday Night Live"" producers Dick Ebersol and Bob Tischler, who hired Louis-Dreyfus, Hall and castmates Gary Kroeger and Paul Barosse to join the NBC series' main cast. Louis-Dreyfus dropped out of Northwestern to appear on ""SNL"" in 1982, and would remain with the series until 1985. Though her tenure there was brief, she did meet Larry David, who was writing for the show during her third and final year. Upon leaving ""SNL,"" Louis-Dreyfus married Hall in 1987 and made appearances in several feature films, including Woody Allen's ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" (1986) and ""Soul Man"" (1986), and co-starred on the short-lived NBC sitcom ""Day By Day"" (1988-1990). When the series ran its course, Louis-Dreyfus was tapped by David and comedian Jerry Seinfeld to join the cast of their sitcom, ""Seinfeld,"" which lacked a central female character amidst its trio of male leads. As the vain, dance-challenged Elaine Benes, Louis-Dreyfus more than held her own against Seinfeld, fellow comic Michael Richards and actor Jason Alexander, and netted seven Emmy nominations, winning one in 1996, as well as a Golden Globe in 1994 and three Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1995, 1997 and 1998. Between seasons, Louis-Dreyfus made occasional forays into feature films, most notably in Woody Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry"" (1997) and the Disney/Pixar animated film ""A Bug's Life"" (1998) but ""Seinfeld"" remained her most prominent showcase until its much-celebrated finale in 1998. She made her first foray as star of her own series in 2002 with ""Watching Ellie"" (NBC, 2002-03), a sitcom created by Hall and starring Louis-Dreyfus as a jazz singer, but the show garnered mixed reviews and was canceled in its second season. Undaunted, she returned to television in 2006, this time for CBS and the sitcom ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" (2006-2010), about a divorced woman balancing her job, family relationships and a friendship with her ex-husband (Clark Gregg) and his new wife. ""Christine"" proved to be a substantial hit that not only dispelled the ""Seinfeld curse"" - so named because of the run of bad career luck experienced by Richards and Alexander - but also confirmed her status as a leading comic talent on television. She would net five consecutive Emmy nominations, winning one in 2006, and when the series ran its course in 2010, Louis-Dreyfus settled into a remarkable streak of creative and career successes, beginning in 2011 with ""Veep."" The HBO comedy series, created by Armando Ianucci and based on his UK series ""The Thick of It"" (BBC Four/Two, 2005-2012), starred Louis-Dreyfus as the foul-mouthed, all-too-human Vice President (and later, presidential candidate) of the United States, and earned nearly universal positive reviews for its acerbic writing and Louis-Dreyfus's performance. She would set records with six Emmy Awards for ""Veep,"" as well as two Screen Actors Guild Awards, which brought her total of the latter laurel to nine. Between ""Veep"" seasons, Louis-Dreyfus kept busy with feature films, including a rare leading turn in Nicole Holofcener's ""Enough Said"" (2013), with Louis-Dreyfus as a masseuse caught between a friendship with a client (Catherine Keener) and a relationship with her ex (James Gandolfini). In the midst of so much praise, Louis-Dreyfus revealed that she had breast cancer in 2017, but underwent treatment and announced that she was free of the disease in 2018. The following year, she returned to Disney/Pixar to lend her voice to their animated feature ""Onward."""
Octavia Spencer,"Possessing the talent to make even the most minor of roles memorable, Octavia Spencer was a fixture for years on both the small and big screens in supporting roles that called for either a caring nurse or a mouthy blue-collar worker. After making her feature film debut in the crime drama ""A Time to Kill"" (1996), Spencer went on to appear on such popular programs as ""Chicago Hope"" (CBS, 1994-2000), ""The X-Files"" (Fox, 1993-2002), and the hit comedy ""Ugly Betty"" (ABC, 2006-2010). Spencer's perfect timing and natural sass also helped her land roles in feature comedies such as ""Big Momma's House"" (2000) and ""Beauty Shop"" (2005), as well as a breakout role on Comedy Central's ""Halfway Home"" (2007), appearing as a loudmouthed ex-con who is always picking fights with her housemates. After many years of paying her dues as background or supporting players, Spencer garnered much-deserved praise and an Oscar for her glowing performance in ""The Help"" (2011), based on Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel of the same name. She was pitch-perfect as Minny Jackson, a determined and sharp-tongued maid who secretly helps an aspiring writer accurately chronicle the lives of African-American domestics in racially-charged 1960s Mississippi. The high-profile role finally thrust Spencer's talents into the forefront, earning her recognition as a truly multifaceted actress. Roles in films ranging from true-life tale of violence ""Fruitvale Station"" (2013) to dystopian science-fiction thriller ""Snowpiercer"" (2013) to animated smash ""Zootopia"" (2016) followed, as well as a second Oscar nomination for her supporting role in the biopic ""Hidden Figures"" (2016), highlighting a trio of African-American women whose work helped NASA win the Cold War space race."
Ali Wong,"Ali Wong was an American actor, writer and comedian who broke out in 2016 with the release of her highly-acclaimed Netflix comedy special ""Baby Cobra"" (Netflix, 2016). Born and raised in the Pacific Heights of San Francisco, Wong never intended on becoming a comedian. A gifted student, she excelled in the classroom and dreamt of becoming an academic. When it came time to enter college, Wong enrolled at UCLA, where she majored in Asian American studies. While attending the school, however, she start acting on stage with an L.A.-based theater company, and with that, her love of performing was born. Wong quickly dropped her ambitions to become an academic, and despite graduating summa cum laude from UCLA, she moved to New York City after graduation to pursue a career in standup comedy. She started working some of New York's most time honored clubs, like the Comedy Cellar, and within a few years had been voted by Variety Magazine as one of ""10 Comics to Watch."" After her profile in Variety, Wong began booking appearance on all the late night shows, including ""The Tonight Show"" (NBC, 1954- ) and ""Chelsea Lately"" (E!, 2007-2014). With her comedy career on the rise, by the early 2010s Wong was also landing recurring acting roles on TV shows like ""Are You There, Chelsea?"" (NBC, 2012), ""Inside Amy Schumer"" (Comedy Central, 2013- ), and ""Black Box"" (ABC, 2014). Then in 2016 Wong got her big break when her first major comedy special ""Baby Cobra"" premiered on Netflix. The special was critically-acclaimed and was noted for featuring Wong when she was 7-months pregnant. In addition to her accelerating standup career, Wong was also working as a writer on the ABC sitcom ""Fresh off the Boat"" (ABC, 2014- ), while continuing to perform standup in her free time. In addition to the premiere of her widely-popular Netflix special, 2016 was also the year Wong joined the cast of the ABC sitcom ""American Housewife"" (ABC, 2016- ). The series debuted on the network in October of that year, with Wong appearing in the cast as a series regular."
John Ratzenberger,"Though his place in pop culture history was cemented by his Emmy-nominated role as know-it-all postman Cliff Clavin on the hit television series ""Cheers"" (NBC, 1982-1993), actor John Ratzenberger enjoyed a long and diverse career in all aspects of the entertainment industry. A solid character actor in such fanboy classics as ""Superman: The Movie"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" Ratzenberger would be one of the few ""Cheers"" castmembers to find consistent work, whether on behind the scenes as a TV series director, or on the big screen, voicing classic characters like Hamm the piggy bank so brilliantly in the ""Toy Story"" film franchise. Surprising fans of the awkward Cliffy Clavin, Ratzenberger proved there was still a spring in his step when, following a last minute cancellation by portly actor Vincent Pastore, the beloved actor filled the open dance card on the phenomenally successful series, ""Dancing with the Stars"" (ABC, 2005- ). Meanwhile, Ratzenberger enjoyed a successful voiceover career, plying his distinctive voice to a number of Pixar hits like the ""Toy Story"" series, ""Finding Nemo"" (2003), ""Ratatouille"" (2007), and ""Up"" (2009). Whether co-starring on a live action series or in hit animated movies, Ratzenberger maintained a steady presence on screens big and small."
Sophie Lowe,"Although her career began in modeling and dancing, as a teen, Sophie Lowe quickly realized that acting was her true love. After appearing in a series of shorts, she landed a starring role in her first feature film, ""Beautiful Kate"" (2009). Small parts in film and TV followed, including a recurring part in the Australian series ""The Slap"" (ABC1, 2011), as well as a role alongside Naomi Watts and Robin Wright in ""Adore"" (2013).

Morgan Saylor,"A naturally gifted dramatic actress, Morgan Saylor jump-started her career with a compelling turn on the award-winning drama ""Homeland"" (Showtime, 2011- ), as the highly perceptive daughter of a U.S. Marine POW who may or may not have been turned into a terrorist. Saylor was born on Oct. 26, 1994 in Chicago, IL but grew up in Atlanta, GA, where she attended Montessori schools. She began performing in community theaters at a young age, before she was signed by a local talent agency. Saylor's television debut was a voice role on the hit series ""The Sopranos"" (HBO, 1999-2007), followed by an appearance on the short-lived police drama ""K-Ville"" (Fox, 2007-08). In 2011, Saylor became a series regular on the critically acclaimed Showtime drama ""Homeland,"" about Nicholas Brody, a U.S. marine (Damian Lewis) who returns home after being held captive in Iraq for eight years, and a determined CIA officer (Claire Danes) who believes that he is plotting an attack on America. Saylor was introduced on the series as a sullen, pot-smoking teenager who helped thwart her father's attempted suicide bomb attack. After earning critical praise for her compelling performance on the series, Saylor's role grew substantially during the second season, and included a controversial romance with the vice president's son and an agonizing fatal hit-and-run accident."
June Squibb,"June Squibb spent most of her six-decade acting career in small supporting roles until she finally gained recognition for her sterling performance in the comedy-drama ""Nebraska"" (2013). Squibb was born on November 6, 1929 in Vandalia, Illinois. In the first half of her acting career, Squibb focused entirely in theater. She trained at the Cleveland Play House, and later moved to New York City where she joined the Herbert Berghof Studio in Greenwich Village. Squibb landed her first big role as Dulcie in an off-Broadway production of ""The Boyfriend"" in 1958. For most actresses, thirty years spent in Broadway, regional theater, musicals, and cabaret would have been a lifetime's worth of acting. However, June's acting career had more to offer when she made her first feature film debut in 1990 alongside Al Pacino in ""Scent of a Woman."" Except for a recurring role as Pearl in ""The Young and the Restless"" (CBS 1973-), most of her ensuing roles were bit parts in big movies and popular television shows such as ""About Schmidt"" (2002) and ""Two and a Half Men"" (CBS 2003-). However, she surprised everyone in the role of Kate Grant in the 2013 film ""Nebraska."" Director Alexander Payne, whom Squibb worked with previously in ""About Schmidt,"" did not initially think to cast her for the role until she sent her audition tape with her two interpretations of Kate's character, one combative and the other restrained. The former won out as Squibb's Kate became the crass and potty-mouthed wife of the movie's central character, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern). Her performance was critically acclaimed, nominated for numerous film critics awards and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture. In January 2014, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that Squibb was one of the year's Best Supporting Actress nominees."

Will Brittain,
Dev Patel,"Prior to 2007, Dev Patel was just another London teenager, albeit one with a passion for acting and tae kwon-do. But after landing a role on the controversial television series ""Skins"" (E4, 2007-13), he caught the attention of director Danny Boyle, who was desperate for a non-traditional leading man of Indian descent for his new film. The picture, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008), was a charming comedy-drama about a young resident of the Mumbai slums who earns a shot at improving his life via the game show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Patel's endearing performance helped to make the film a hit with festival audiences around the world; it also signaled the emergence of a comic talent whose full screen potential had yet to be tapped. Patel went on to star in the romantic comedy ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" (2015) and its sequel ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" (2015), indie drama ""The Road Within"" (2014) and Neill Blonkamp's science fiction drama ""Chappie"" (2015), as well as taking on a supporting role in Aaron Sorkin's cable news drama ""The Newsroom"" (HBO 2012-14).

Tilda Swinton,"Tilda Swinton was an Academy Award-winning British actress who achieved widespread praise for her daring roles in acclaimed films like ""Adaptation"" (2002), ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" (2011), and ""Michael Clayton"" (2007). Born into a privileged family in London (her father's Scottish roots trace all the way back to the Middle Ages), Swinton attended various boarding schools as a young girl, which she found isolating and lonely. When it came time to attend college, Swinton chose the University of Cambridge, where she would go on to earn a degree in social and political sciences. It was at Cambridge that Swinton first became involved in acting. She began appearing in plays while studying at Cambridge, and after graduation joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company. Swinton made her debut with the Royal Shakespeare Company by appearing in ""Measure for Measure."" Swinton continued honing her acting craft on the London stage throughout the 1980s, but by the end of the decade she began transitioning into film acting. It was during this period that Swinton appeared in a number of experimental films by the English director Derek Jarman. These films included ""Caravaggio"" (1986), ""The Last of England"" (1988), and ""The Garden"" (1990). Swinton continued acting in independent films throughout the 90s, and although many of these films were not widely seen by the public, she consistently earned plaudits from critics. At the turn of the century, with over a decade of acting experience behind her, Swinton began making the transition into more mainstream films. She appeared in award-winning films like ""Adaptation"" and ""Broken Flowers"" (2005) during this period, as well as the big budget action film ""Constantine"" (2005).

Hugh Laurie,"Though many American fans know Hugh Laurie best for his iconic role on the medical drama ""House"" (Fox, 2004-2012), viewers in Britain knew him far earlier for his wildly popular comedy work with creative partner Stephen Fry. Born in Oxford, England in 1959, Laurie was a successful member of his high school rowing team. He continued rowing after enrolling at Cambridge University, but after a bout of mononucleosis forced him to quit the team, Laurie discovered an unexpected new path in life by joining the Footlights drama club. It was there that he met and began working with Fry, performing their bits for theatrical audiences. Eventually, they brought their talents to the television screen on the sketch series ""Alfresco"" (ITV, 1983-84), shortly before they both joined the cast of the cult favorite series ""The Black Adder"" (BBC, 1986-1996) alongside Rowan Atkinson. Meanwhile, Laurie and Fry would find a new TV home for their collaborations when they began co-writing and co-starring on the sketch series ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"" (BBC, 1987-1995).

He would stick with the series until 2012, going on to star on the series ""Chance"" (Hulu, 2016-) before signing on to star with George Clooney and Kyle Chandler in a mini-series adaptation of the novel ""Catch-22"" (Hulu, 2019)."
Peter Capaldi,"Scottish actor Peter Capaldi was one of the United Kingdom's best-kept secrets for decades until the summer of 2013, when he went from being ""who?"" to Doctor Who. A native Glaswegian, the wiry Capaldi gravitated towards performing in his youth, and initially gained notice for his supporting role in the beloved comedic drama ""Local Hero"" (1983). He went on to become a British television mainstay, while occasionally appearing in feature films. Following recurring roles or guest spots on various small-screen productions, he sidestepped into writing and directing with the short film ""Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life"" (1995), which won both a BAFTA and Academy Award. Primarily sticking to on-screen work, Capaldi found his breakout role in 2005 as the fierce political mastermind Malcolm Tucker on the biting comedy ""The Thick of It"" (BBC, 2005-2012). In 2009, his international reputation grew when the series spun off into the acclaimed feature comedy ""In the Loop"" (2009), co-starring James Gandolfini. However, his profile was later raised considerably higher when it was announced that Capaldi would be the Twelfth Doctor on the venerable sci-fi series ""Doctor Who"" (BBC, 1963-1989, 1996, 2005- ), bringing him instant global attention. Capaldi remained in the role until the 2017 Christmas special, when he made way for the Thirteenth Doctor, played by Jodie Whittaker."
Ben Whishaw,
Gwendoline Christie,"With the incredible popularity of ""Game of Thrones"" (HBO, 2011- ), a number of actors became stars and fan favorites from the show. Once Gwendoline Christie came aboard in the role of Brienne of Tarth, her career took off, leading to featured appearances in ""The Hunger Games"" films as well as the ultimate fanboy franchise, the resurrection of the ""Star Wars"" universe. Christie was born in 1978 in Worthing, West Sussex, and grew up near South Downs. Christie grew very tall, 6'3, and was going to be a gymnast, but after injuring her back she turned to acting instead. Christie graduated from Drama Centre London in 2005, and was mentored by Simon Callow, a British actor and author who had featured roles in ""Amadeus"" (1984) and ""Shakespeare In Love"" (1998). In the British acting tradition, Christie performed in the theater, playing the Queen in Shakespeare's ""Cymbeline,"" and as Lucifer in ""Doctor Faustus."" Then Christie went to the big screen with roles in Terry Gilliam's ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" (2009), which featured the last performance of Heath Ledger, and ""The Zero Theorem"" (2013). Christie was cast as Brienne of Tarth in ""Game of Thrones"" in July 2011. The character was a cult favorite, and her fans were suggesting online that she would be perfect for the role before she officially came aboard. Christie's first appearance on ""Thrones"" was on the third episode of season two, which aired on April 15, 2012. As Christie's popularity as an actress grew, she landed the role of Commander Lyme in ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part One"" (2014) and its second half, the last two installments of the popular young adult franchise. This led to Christie landing in another major franchise with a fervent fan following. Riding the crest of her popularity, Christie portrayed a key villain in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), the long awaited return of the legendary space opera, alongside Lupita N'yongo and Adam Driver."
Chadwick Boseman,"A charismatic performer with an easy Everyman presence, Chadwick Boseman paid his acting dues for a full decade before taking the spotlight with his starring turn in the Jackie Robinson biopic ""42"" (2013). With strong roots in theater, Boseman made a name for himself as a stage actor, director and playwright prior to landing notable screen roles. In 2003, he began appearing on television in one-off guest spots on various procedural dramas before joining the cast of the drama ""Lincoln Heights"" (ABC Family, 2007-09) as recurring character Nate Ray Taylor. Boseman subsequently found a regular part on the mysterious thriller series ""Persons Unknown"" (NBC, 2010), but the show was quickly cancelled. A starring role in the little-seen action movie ""The Kill Hole"" (2012) followed, but Boseman bounced back from this relative disappointment with the lead in Brian Helgeland's historical baseball drama ""42,"" a film that placed him squarely on the Hollywood map. Performances as James Brown in the biopic ""Get On Up"" (2014) and in the blockbusters ""Gods of Egypt"" (2016) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) maintained his standing as one of Hollywood's hottest young actors before his title performance in the blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018) made him an international superstar. Born in South Carolina, Chadwick Boseman gravitated towards the theater in his youth, going on to attend both Howard University in Washington, D.C. and the British American Dramatic Academy in Oxford, England. Establishing himself as a notable up-and-comer in African-American-centric theater productions, a number of which he wrote and directed, Boseman eventually set his sights on screen acting. Starting out in brief guest roles on procedural dramas such as ""Third Watch"" (NBC, 1999-2005) and ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010), he finally garnered more notable parts in 2008, with a supporting role in the football movie ""The Express"" and an extended arc on the family drama ""Lincoln Heights,"" where he played a troubled young war vet. Boseman was seemingly on the verge on his big break when he was cast as the key character of another military vet, Sergeant Graham McNair, in Christopher McQuarrie's high-concept mystery series ""Persons Unknown"" (NBC, 2010). Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after 13 episodes, leaving him to return to one-off appearances on various television dramas, including fan-favorite fare such as ""Fringe"" (Fox, 2008-2013) and ""Justified"" (FX, 2010-15). Following a featured turn in the widely panned low-budget action film ""The Kill Hole"" (2012), Boseman's fortunes changed considerably. Veteran Hollywood writer/director Brian Helgeland tapped Boseman to play the main role of pioneering baseball player Jackie Robinson in the hit drama ""42,"" a production that not only led to immediate recognition for his determined performance, but also found him acting alongside film icon Harrison Ford. After playing another athlete opposite Kevin Costner in Ivan Reitman's ""Draft Day"" (2014), Boseman took on the task of portraying another influential black figure of the 20th century in the James Brown biopic ""Get On Up"" (2014). Boseman next appeared in Alex Proyas' Biblical epic ""Gods of Egypt"" and as the superhero Black Panther in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) before gearing up for starring roles as Thurgood Marshall in ""Marshall"" (2016) and in his own superhero action fest, ""Black Panther"" (2018), which was a massive critical and commercial success upon its February 2018 release. Boseman returned to the role later that year in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018). He next starred in the action thriller ""21 Bridges"" (2019) and appeared in Spike Lee's Vietnam drama ""Da 5 Bloods"" (2020).  Chadwick Boseman died at his home in Los Angeles on August 28, 2020 at the age of 43, following a four-year battle with colon cancer. His final film role was in the posthumous ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" which he completed in 2019."
Michael B. Jordan,"An assured and mature actor from an early age, Michael B. Jordan brought the complex web of heartbreak and triumph inherent to young, disadvantaged black men to vivid life in a number of acclaimed performances. Though his roles tended to be cut from the same dramatic cloth - his most significant characters were young men from troubled urban homes who fought to wrest control of their own lives - Jordan's naturalistic performances helped to bring each to life. Whether playing a young man caught up in the false promise of the drug trade on ""The Wire"" (HBO, 2002-08), a talented but troubled high school athlete on ""Friday Night Lights"" (NBC/101 Network, 2006-2011) or a man struggling to move beyond his past on ""Parenthood"" (NBC, 2010-15), Jordan infused each role with a riveting intensity. A jump to feature film work landed Jordan a turn in George Lucas' World War II aerial action drama ""Red Tails"" (2012) and a co-starring role in the surprise hit ""Chronicle"" (2012) as one of three teens who mysteriously find themselves endowed with superpowers. For his lead role in the based-on-fact drama ""Fruitvale Station"" (2013), Jordan went from promising young talent to acclaimed actor. He followed that breakthrough film success with a string of increasingly high-profile roles in hits like the ""Rocky"" (1975) sequel ""Creed"" (2015) and Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018)."
Lupita Nyong'o,"Rare is a feature film debut met with much acclaim, but rarer still is a talent such as Lupita Nyong'o. Hailing from Kenya by way of Mexico (where she was born in 1983) Nyong'o was the daughter of a Kenyan politician. In fact, it was during his time as a visiting lecturer in Mexico City that she came to be born in that country, with the family eventually moving back to Kenya when she was a year old. However, in addition to being sent back to Mexico by her parents later in life to learn Spanish, Nyong'o set out abroad for her education as well, this time to the United States to attend both Hampshire College and Yale University. During her time in school, she appeared in a number of stage productions. Following graduation, she made her initial foray into movies behind the camera, working on the production teams of films such as ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005) and ""The Namesake"" (2006). In 2009, she created, directed, produced and edited a documentary entitled ""In My Genes"" for her final thesis project at Hampshire. The project - focusing on the societal and personal challenges faced by Kenya's albino population - was a coming home for Nyong'o, who moved back to Nairobi around this time. Once there, she produced a video for MTV and eventually starred in a TV series, ""Shuga."" All of these achievements paled, however, compared to her casting as Patsey in director Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). Nyong'o's searing performance was widely praised by both critics and audiences, and resulted in the rising young star winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Following a supporting part in the Liam Neeson/Julianne Moore thriller ""Non-Stop"" (2014), Nyong'o next appeared in a motion-capture CGI role as Maz Katana in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), a role she repeated in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017). In between, Nyong'o essayed a voice role as Raksha in Jon Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" (2016) and starred opposite David Oyelowo in sports biography ""Queen of Katwe"" (2016). In 2018, she joined the all-star cast of the Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018)."
Danai Gurira,"Actress and playwright Danai Gurira won critical acclaim with her first play, ""In the Continuum"" (2006), which addressed social and political issues in her parents' home country of Africa. She would pen two more well regarded works - 2009's ""Eclipsed"" and 2011's ""The Convert, both of which concerned African issues - while enjoying a second career as an actress on television and in features like ""The Visitor"" (2009). Two years later, Gurira would enjoy her most prominent acting turn as the flinty zombie fighter Michonne on ""The Walking Dead"" (AMC, 2010- ). The positive response to her performance, in addition to her growing profile in the theater world, indicated that Gurira was poised for stardom in both mediums. Born Danai Jekesai Gurira on Feb. 14, 1978 in Grinnell, IA, she was the second of two children born to academic parents from Zimbabwe, who moved the family back to Africa when she was five years old. There, she enjoyed a happy childhood that soon became focused on performing. After high school, she returned to the United States, where she attended Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota before earning her masters degree in acting from the Tisch School at New York University. With Nikkole Salter, she wrote the off-Broadway play, ""In the Continuum"" (2006), about the lives of two women infected with HIV, which won the Obie and Outer Critics Circle Awards for writing, while Gurira herself claimed the Helen Hayes Award for Best Lead Actress in 2007. That same year, she made her feature film debut in ""The Visitor"" (2007) as a young Senegalese woman who helped a widowed economics professor (Richard Jenkins) find joy and purpose in his life. Minor roles in ""Ghost Town"" (2008) and Wes Craven's ""My Soul to Take"" (2010) soon followed, as did Gurira's Broadway debut as an actress in a production of August Wilson's ""Joe Turner's Come and Gone"" in 2009. That same year, she premiered her second play, ""Eclipsed"" (2009), about a quartet of women held captive by a rebel leader during the war in Liberia in 2003. The production won Best New Play at the 2010 Helen Hayes Awards as well as Best Playwright for Gurira from the NAACP Theater Awards that same year. In 2011, she appeared in William Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure"" with the New York Shakespeare Festival, and then premiered her third play, ""The Convert,"" about a teenage girl in 19th century Zimbabwe who turned to Christianity to evade an arranged marriage. Like its predecessors, the play won several major theater awards, including the 2011 Stavis Award and Edgerton Foundation New American Plays Award. After enjoying a supporting role in a six-episode story arc on ""Treme"" (HBO, 2010-13), Gurira earned her breakout screen role as Michonne, a tough, resourceful new character on the third season of ""The Walking Dead""; Michonne immediately became not only a fan favorite, but one of the series' most important characters Gurira was subsequently cast as the lead in ""Mother of George"" (2013), an independent drama with an African setting. In addition to her acting and playwrighting careers, Gurira was co-founder of Almasi, an organization devoted to supporting arts education in Zimbabwe. In 2015, Gurira's fourth play, ""Familiar,"" was produced. After playing the mother of iconic rapper Tupac Shakur in the biopic ""All Eyez on Me"" (2017), Gurira joined the cast of another international phenomenon with her role as Okoye in the blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018). She reprised the role later the same year in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018)."
Martin Freeman,"With a knack for milking comedy gold out of awkward situations, English actor Martin Freeman became a mainstay on the BBC prior to expanding his work to international film. After a number of years spent paying his dues with minor parts, Freeman broke out as the prank-loving Tim Canterbury on Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's hit sitcom ""The Office"" (BBC 1/BBC 2, 2001-03). The increasingly popular actor jumped to the big screen, first with a supporting role in the ensemble romance ""Love Actually"" (2003), followed by the lead in the inspired adaptation of the cult classic novel ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" (2005). An exceptionally prolific period followed, during which Freeman divided his time between television work and appearances in such films as the action-comedy ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007). The actor garnered more acclaim than ever before when he was cast in the role of Dr. John Watson on the modernized interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic creation ""Sherlock"" (BBC 1, 2010- ) opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as the eccentric super-sleuth. Freeman's scored his biggest role yet as the diminutive Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (2012), the first in another trilogy based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Freeman continued his work in both comedy and drama, appearing in films ranging from war correspondent satire ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (2016) to post-apocalyptic thriller ""Cargo"" (2017), while also appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Black Panther"" (2018) and gaining critical acclaim in the first series of crime anthology ""Fargo"" (FX 2015- ). While known for his comedic acumen, Freeman's everyman appeal and impressive range made him one of the more sought after British imports of his day."
Daniel Kaluuya,"Born in London, Daniel Kaluuya's career in entertainment started off in a way that became somewhat typical for young British actors in the mid-2000s. He first appeared in the BBC film ""Shoot the Messenger"" (2006) and followed that up with a recurring role on the teen drama ""Skins"" (E4 2007-2013), where he played the role of Posh Kenneth and also joined the writing staff. His notoriety on ""Skins"" led to many TV appearances in England, including guest spots on ""Doctor Who"" (BBC 1963- ) and the crime drama ""Silent Witness"" (BBC 1996- ), and the sketch comedy show ""That Mitchell and Webb Look"" (BBC 2006-2010). While he appeared somewhat regularly on television, Kaluuya also took to the stage, earning acclaim for a number of performances. After a small part in the Rowan Atkinson comedy ""Johnny English Reborn"" (2011), his presence in films started to pick up, as he then broke more into the American mainstream as the villainous Black Death in the comic book film ""Kick-Ass 2"" (2013). He then followed that up with a role as an FBI agent in crime drama ""Sicario"" (2015). At the end of 2016, it was announced he would play the role of W'Kabi in the Marvel film ""Black Panther"" (2018). Shortly after the announcement, the Jordan Peele-directed horror film ""Get Out"" (2017) came out to rave reviews and box office success. Kaluuya received much praise, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, for his breakout performance in the film about an African-American man (Kaluuya) meeting his girlfriend's parents in a small suburban town. Kaluuya was next seen as W'Kabi in the blockbuster superhero film ""Black Panther"" (2018)."
Robert Downey Jr.,"Despite Oscar and Golden Globe nominations and the unshakeable respect of film critics and his acting peers, Robert Downey, Jr. insisted that he was not really an actor, just a good hustler who had found a way to make a living. If he did not believe he was acting, it was certainly reflected in his seamless skills, which were full of natural, physical expressiveness. After making himself known as the drug-addicted antihero of ""Less Than Zero"" (1987), Downey delivered an uncanny portrayal of beloved silent film star ""Chaplin"" (1992), which earned him some of the highest praise of his career. But his gift had always been to transform a regular person into a creatively-detailed and thoroughly engrossing star of the show, often complete with memorable quirks. Even in his early roles in teen comedies, Downey stood out above his Brat Pack peers for his spontaneous energy and apparent fearlessness in exposing his very fragile inner workings. Though he made headlines for his manic portrayal of a tabloid TV journalist in ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994) and a gay book editor in ""Wonder Boys"" (2000), Downey unfortunately became more famous for his longtime drug addictions and numerous run-ins with the law. He eventually emerged from almost certain tragedy by attaining sobriety and re-launching his flagging career with a blockbuster starring turn in the hit ""Iron Man"" (2008), while earning laughs as a chameleon-like actor in ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), which only confirmed that the public loved a good comeback story as well as appreciated Downey's incredibly likeable presence on the big screen. Continuing his role as Iron Man throughout the series of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including the blockbuster hit ""The Avengers"" (2012) and its sequels, Downey also starred in films ranging from ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) to familial legal drama ""The Judge"" (2014). In 2019, he would appear again as Tony Stark in ""Avengers: Endgame,"" reported to be the conclusion to the story of the original Avengers team. He also filmed a starring role in ""The Voyage of Dr. Dolittle"" (2020), and, through his banner Team Downey, was producing a remake of ""Perry Mason"" for HBO."
Chris Evans,"Actor Chris Evans began his acting career in typical fashion, but it was his rapid rise to stardom which was unusual. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade, Evans started out appearing in school plays and theater camp; from there it was a quick jump to local community theater, and later, an internship for a casting office. Once Evans made friends with a few agents on the job, it was a straight shot to television and blockbuster features. One of the more talented of the fair-haired, pretty-boy actors to emerge in the early years of the new millennium, Evans scored with roles in a succession of high-profile releases. His breakthrough came in 2005 when he was tapped to play the role of the Human Torch in director Tim Story's adaptation of the Marvel Comics classic ""The Fantastic Four"" and its subsequent sequel, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (2007). By the time he starred in ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" (2010) and as Captain America, one of the central pillars of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in films including ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011), ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), Evans was a star assured of accomplishing even greater things. Simultaneously, his work starring in and directing romantic drama ""Before We Go"" (2014) and starring in family drama ""Gifted"" (2017) showed off his non-superhero range."
Mark Ruffalo,"Like many other actors who were tagged ""best of a generation,"" Mark Ruffalo's roots were in theater and independent film where his honest, open character approach was applauded. His breakout stage role in Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed ""This Is Our Youth"" led Lonergan to give Ruffalo the lead in his film directorial debut ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000), which earned countless festival awards and had critics buzzing about the little-known actor's subtle, compelling performance as a cerebral but aimless young adult with an arrest record and a pregnant teenage girlfriend. Hollywood came courting, but struggled with a tidy niche in which to put the darkly handsome actor; first offering him small but effective character roles as ""conflicted"" types in big budget thrillers like ""Collateral"" (2004) before unsuccessfully making the understated actor into a bland leading man in romantic comedies like ""Just Like Heaven"" (2005). Ruffalo eventually found an appropriate arena somewhere between the multiplex and the art house, favored by character-driven directors like Jane Campion, David Fincher, Steven Zaillian and eventually Martin Scorsese - all of whom capitalized on the actor's talent for believably disappearing into complex, empathetic characters."
Chris Hemsworth,"Tall, muscular and exceptionally handsome, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth became a star in the U.S. with a series of well-received genre films. He was a household name in his native country while starring on the popular drama series, ""Home and Away"" (7 Network, 1988- ), playing an opinionated student navigating his way through high school in a seaside town. He quickly became a sci-fi sensation across the pond with a brief but memorable role in the J.J. Abrams reboot of the worldwide phenomenon ""Star Trek"" (2009) as Capt. James T. Kirk's ill-fated father. But it was not until he landed the lead role in the film version of the comic book hero ""Thor"" (2011) - beating out his younger brother, fellow heartthrob Liam, in the process - that Hemsworth truly flexed his muscles, establishing himself as one of the most charismatic young actors of the moment. Lionsgate films quickly capitalized on Hemsworth's popularity by releasing the long-delayed horror feature ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012), co-written by Joss Whedon. Ironically, it was Whedon who later directed the young star in the superhero blockbuster ""The Avengers"" (2012), bringing together ""Thor"" and Marvel Studios' other franchise films. Along with his continuing screen presence as the Nordic superhero, Hemsworth expanded with range with films ranging from the thriller ""Blackhat"" (2015), Ron Howard's sailing drama ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (2015), and two fantasy films based on fairy tales, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016). As talented as he was attractive, Hemsworth was without a doubt, a leading man to watch."
Scarlett Johansson,"Scarlett Johansson moved from being an indie darling to one of the most recognizable actresses in the world thanks to her standing as a member of Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012). A native of Manhattan, she began studying acting as a child and made her screen debut at the age of nine in ""North"" (1994). The actress played the daughter of John Ritter in the Rob Reiner comedy. Similarly, she was cast as Sean Connery's daughter in the drama ""Just Cause"" (1995). The actress earned her first starring role playing opposite Aleksa Palladino in ""Manny & Lo"" (1996) about a pair of sisters running away from foster care. She was featured in director Eric Schaeffer's ""If Lucy Fell"" (1996) and ""Fall"" (1997). She had roles as well in the broad comedy ""Home Alone 3"" (1997) and Robert Redford's ""The Horse Whisperer"" (1998). Johansson began establishing her indie credentials when she teamed with Thora Birch for Terry Zwigoff's dark comedy ""Ghost World"" (2001). After a supporting role in the action comedy ""Eight Legged Freaks"" (2002), the actress began her march towards stardom in earnest. Director Sofia Coppola cast her as the disillusioned young woman who hangs out with Bill Murray's jaded actor during a trip to Tokyo in ""Lost in Translation"" (2003). She followed with a role as the muse to Colin Firth's Johannes Vermeer in ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" (2003). The following year she starred with future ""Avengers"" co-star Chris Evans in ""The Perfect Score"" (2004) and teamed with John Travolta in ""A Love Song for Bobby Long"" (2004). She would add roles opposite Helen Hunt in ""A Good Woman"" (2004) and as Dennis Quaid's daughter in ""In Good Company"" (2004). Woody Allen cast the actress as the lead in his ""Match Point"" (2005), and Michael Bay did likewise for his thriller ""The Island"" (2005). She would work with Allen again when he cast her alongside Hugh Jackman as a journalism student investigating a serial killer. She continued to work at an impressive clip, starring in ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006), ""The Prestige"" (2006), ""The Nanny Diaries"" (2007), and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (2008) in succession. Allen again used the actress, this time partnered with Rebecca Hall and Javier Bardem for ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" (2008). The actress also began mixing in Broadway performances, earning a Tony for her role opposite Liev Schreiber in ""A View from the Bridge."" She went from drama to blockbuster, though, when she agreed to play former assassin Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Johansson made her debut as the character in the Robert Downey Jr. vehicle ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and brought the character to fruition fully in ""The Avengers."" Outside of the superhero world, she starred with Matt Damon in ""We Bought a Zoo"" (2011) and portrayed actress Janet Leigh in ""Hitchcock"" (2012). Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt cast her in his directorial debut ""Don Jon"" (2013). Even though she didn't appear on screen, Johansson gained notice for voicing a virtual assistant that Joaquin Phoenix forms an unhealthy bond with in Spike Jonze's ""Her"" (2013). She continued her trend of working with strong directors when she co-starred in Jon Favreau's ""Chef"" (2014). The Marvel world soon beckoned, however, and she returned to playing Black Widow for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015). Having proven her physical prowess in the superhero films, she starred as a genetically altered woman in Luc Besson's thriller ""Lucy"" (2014). She would later join the ensemble cast of the Coen Brothers' Hollywood comedy ""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016) and starred in the live-action remake of the anime classic ""Ghost in the Shell"" (2017). She also starred with Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer in the comedy ""Rough Night"" (2017). Her run as Black Widow reached a whole new level with ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). The three films would combine to take in more than $5-billion dollars at the box office worldwide. She gained positive reviews for her role opposite Adam Driver in ""Marriage Story"" (2019) playing an actress going through a divorce. She also appeared in Taika Waititi's inventive ""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019). After appearing as Natasha Romanoff alongside a variety of other superheroes, Johansson's character was finally given a stand-alone film with ""Black Widow"" (2020)."
Jeremy Renner,"After years of struggle, actor Jeremy Renner earned a reputation as a reliable lead in dark-themed dramas, thanks initially to his stellar portrayal of infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in the biopic, ""Dahmer"" (2002). With no qualms about taking a turn to the dark side, Renner added to his esteem with acclaimed indie turns as a white supremacist in ""Neo Ned"" (2005) and a sexist boss in ""North Country"" (2005). He tackled more complex roles with sterling performances as a former L.A.P.D. cop in ""S.W.A.T."" (2003) and as the intimidating Wood Hite, cousin to Frank and Jesse James, in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007). Though a recognizable face, Renner finally broke through as a household name following his critically lauded turn as an on-edge bomb disposal expert operating in the Oscar-winning Iraq War thriller, ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009). From there, he earned himself an Oscar nomination with a finely tuned turn as a career criminal in Ben Affleck's widely hailed crime drama, ""The Town"" (2010), which soon led to roles in blockbuster movies like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), ""The Avengers"" (2011) and ""The Bourne Legacy"" (2012). With each critical nod, Renner secured a firmer footing in Hollywood as a recognizable and dependable face in a variety of feature films."

In 2018, she joined the all-star cast of the Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018)."
Winston Duke,"Born in Tobago in the southern Caribbean, actor Winston Duke immigrated to the United States when he was nine years old. He began acting in productions at the Portland Stage Company and at his alma mater, Yale University. Duke's first appearance on the small screen came in 2014 when he was cast on an episode of ""Law & Order: SVU"" (NBC, 1999-). He followed up this effort with a seven-episode arc as Dominic on ""Person of Interest"" (CBS, 2011-16). In 2015 Duke appeared in three episodes of ""The Messenger"" (CW, 2015). Duke appeared in another police procedural, ""Major Crimes"" (TNT, 2012- ), that same year. In 2016 Duke appeared in three episodes of ""Modern Family"" (ABC, 2009-) as Dwight, a gifted high school football player who moved in temporarily with Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson). In 2018, Duke co-starred as the villain M'Baku in the Marvel superhero blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018), a role he reprised in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018)."
Elisabeth Moss,"Actress Elisabeth Moss wasted no time getting her career off the ground. Starting as a child actor, Moss graduated high school two years early. As a result of her unusually mature work ethic, Moss was rarely without a job. After working steadily in film and television for years, Moss landed her big break in 1999 when she was cast as Martin Sheen's daughter on ""The West Wing"" (NBC, 1999-2006). Moving from her supporting berth at the White House, Moss took on an even more high-profile role as 1960s-era secretary-turned-copywriter Peggy Olson on ""Mad Men"" (AMC, 2007-15), the critically acclaimed drama from ""The Sopranos"" (HBO, 1999-2007) writer-producer, Matthew Weiner. As that series continued, Peggy became one of its most important characters as a foil to and protégé of conflicted adman Don Draper (Jon Hamm), Even before ""Mad Men"" ended in 2015, Moss went on to strong work as the lead of Jane Campion's murder mystery ""Top of the Lake"" (Sundance 2013) and its sequel ""Top of the Lake: China Girl"" (Sundance 2017) before starring as Offred in the Emmy Award-winning drama ""The Handmaid's Tale"" (Hulu 2017- ). Poised and talented, Moss seemed ready for any acting challenge on the big or small screen."
Tim Heidecker,"With his partner Eric Wareheim, multihyphenate Tim Heidecker oversaw some of the most offbeat and challenging television comedy programming of the new millennium, including ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" (Adult Swim, 2006), ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"" (Adult Swim, 2007-2010) and ""Tim & Eric's Bedtime Stories"" (Adult Swim, 2014- ). The Pennsylvania natives teamed in 1994 while students at Temple University, and quickly established themselves in alternative comedy circles with their unique perspective on entertainment and popular culture. As the main writers, directors and stars in their series, Heidecker and Wareheim celebrated the most uncomfortable and occasionally unpleasant elements of amateur productions, public access television, late-night commercials and vanity projects; their comedy style hewed somewhere between the free-form absurdity of ""Mr. Show""  (HBO, 1995-98) and the disquieting awkwardness of confrontational surrealists like David Lynch or Werner Herzog. The duo's cutting edge comedy attracted numerous big name guest stars like Will Ferrell and Ben Stiller, and led to guest appearances for Heidecker in Hollywood projects like ""Bridesmaids"" (2011). And if mainstream audiences didn't wholly embrace his own efforts with Wareheim, the best of their work remained some of the most adventurous, cutting-edge comedy programming on television."
Yahya Abdul-Mateen II,"A critically praised turn as a fleet-footed club owner on ""The Get Down"" (Netflix, 2016-17) gave actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen a career boost that led to major roles in ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017) and ""Aquaman"" (2018). Born July 15, 1987 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Abdul-Mateen was raised in the city's Magnolia Projects before relocating with his family to Oakland, California. There, he harbored a desire to become an actor, but pursued a career in architecture, earning a degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and working for a period of time as a city planner in San Francisco. But upon being laid off, Abdul-Mateen took a risk and focused his energy on becoming an actor; he was soon cast in a local stage production, which prompted him to apply to the Yale Drama School, where he earned a master's degree in fine arts. More stage work followed, including roles with the Williamstown Festival in Massachusetts and New York's Shakespeare in the Park, before Abdul-Mateen made his television debut as Cadillac, a vain, disco-dancing club owner in the Baz Luhrmann-produced ""The Get Down."" The praise afforded to him by his performance led to steady and diverse work in features and on television; in the former capacity, he moved deftly from broad comedies like ""Baywatch"" (2017) to musicals like ""The Greatest Showman,"" which cast him as acrobat W.D. Wheeler, and indie efforts like ""First Match"" (2018), for which he played the estranged father of a teenaged girl and aspiring wrestler. On the small screen, Abdul-Mateen appeared on ""The Handmaid's Tale"" (Hulu, 2017- ) and was cast in HBO's ""Watchmen"" series, but his breakout role came in theaters when he was tapped to play the undersea bounty hunter Black Manta, longtime nemesis to ""Aquaman"" in James Wan's feature adaptation of the venerable DC Comics fantasy title."
Anna Diop,"Actress Ana Diop moved swiftly from bit parts and recurring roles on episodic television before joining the cast of such high-profile projects as Oprah Winfrey's ""Greenleaf"" (OWN, 2016- ) and ""24: Legacy"" (Fox, 2017- ). Born in Senegal, Diop moved with her family to the United States at the age of six. In her teens, she decided to pursue a career in acting and relocated to New York. There, she met a talent agent who encouraged her to go to Los Angeles. Diop made her television debut in 2006 with a recurring role on the sitcom ""Everybody Hates Chris"" (UPN/The CW, 2005-09). She worked steadily in guest appearances on series like ""Whitney"" (NBC, 2011-13) and ""Southland"" (NBC/TNT, 2009-2013) before making her feature film debut in the independent thriller ""The Moment"" (2013) opposite Jennifer Jason Leigh. Diop moved up to series regular with the ambitious fantasy-thriller series ""The Messengers"" (The CW, 2014-15), playing a murderous nurse who returned from a coma to assume the role of Death in the Four Horsemen. The series lasted a single season, and Diop moved on to a recurring role on the Oprah Winfrey-produced ""Greenleaf"" before joining the cast of the highly anticipated ""24: Legacy,"" a spin-off of the Kiefer Sutherland series, with Corey Hawkins as a former Army Ranger targeted by terrorists. Diop was cast as Hawkins' spouse, who was previously engaged to his brother, played by Ashley Thomas."
Tom Hanks,"With an on-screen persona so likeable that he was often referred to as ""America's Dad,"" Tom Hanks cemented a reputation as one of the most respected actors of his generation. Born in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks participated in school plays, discovering that acting was a good outlet for his energy and wit. He went on to study theater at California State University, Sacramento and as a three-year intern at Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. He finally moved to New York in 1979 and made his film debut in the low budget horror movie ""He Knows You're Alone"" (1979). The following year, Hanks landed his first big break, co-starring in the sitcom ""Bosom Buddies"" (ABC, 1980-82) with Peter Scolari. He starred in the hit fantasy-comedy ""Splash"" (1984) with Daryl Hannah two years later, which he quickly followed with the zany comedy ""Bachelor Party"" (1984). Hanks' feature film career was off and running, and he continued his hot streak with the comedies ""The Man with One Red Shoe"" (1985) and ""The Money Pit"" (1985). Though he experienced some turbulence in his personal life when he and wife Samantha Lewes were divorced in 1987, his next professional triumph remained just around the corner, as he was soon starring as a 13 year old boy trapped in a 32 year old man's body in Penny Marshall's smash hit ""Big"" (1988). Hanks remarried actor Rita Wilson that same year, and embarked on a string of cult hits like ""The 'Burbs'"" (1989) and ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" (1990). By 1992, he was well established as star and ready for the next phase in his career, and he impressed both audiences and critics with an unexpected performance as a washed up baseball player turned coach in the acclaimed World War II era sports film ""A League of Their Own"" (1992). Hanks quickly followed this with a turn as a widowed father looking for love opposite Meg Ryan in the massively popular ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (1993). He followed this with two back-to-back award-winning performances, one as a gay man suffering from both AIDS and discrimination in ""Philadelphia"" (1993), and another as an intellectually limited man who plays a pivotal role in history in Ron Howard's ""Forrest Gump"" (1994). Hanks would reteam with Howard the following year to portray astronaut Jim Lovell in ""Apollo 13"" (1995), the same year he began voice acting the role of cowboy doll Woody in the cutting-edge CG family film ""Toy Story"" (1995). Ready to expand his horizons further, Hanks next opted to direct his first feature, the period movie ""That Thing You Do!"" (1996), in which he also played a supporting role. Hanks rounded out the '90s with a turn in the acclaimed war film ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) before reteaming with Meg Ryan for another romance, ""You've Got Mail"" (1998). Hanks reprised the role of Woody for ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) before wowing audiences with his performance as a man battling for survival against both loneliness and the elements in ""Cast Away"" (2000). The 2000s would bring still more nuanced and relatable roles for Hanks in films like ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) and ""The Terminal"" (2004). He took on the lead role of Robert Langdon in the hotly anticipated film adaptation of the bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006) as well as the sequel ""Angels & Demons"" (2009), and was greeted with as much affection as ever with his third performance as Woody in ""Toy Story 3"" (2010). Hanks directed and starred in his second feature, ""Larry Crowne"" (2011) in 2011. As a whole, the 2010s would find Hanks utilizing the gravity and trust that came with his own screen persona, playing famous figures like Walt Disney in ""Saving Mr Banks"" (2013), pirate survivor Captain Richard Phillips in ""Captain Phillips"" (2013), and pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger in ""Sully"" (2016). After reprising Robert Langdon for ""Inferno"" (2016) and Woody for ""Toy Story 4"" (2019), Hanks took on the role of children's television pioneer Fred Rogers in ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" (2019)."
Tim Allen,"Smarter than his grunting comedic persona suggested, Tim Allen turned his stand-up into a successful Hollywood career. Early setbacks like the death of his father and a stint in prison gave Allen the drive to pursue comedy, and his affectionate dissection of the differences between the genders -- focusing especially on the confusions of modern masculinity -- spring-boarded him to stand-up stardom, leading to the massive hit sitcom, ""Home Improvement"" (ABC, 1991-99). The show won him buckets of awards and fans around the world for his portrayal of lovable lunkhead Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor. Notching a No. 1 book Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man, a TV show and a hit movie at the same time in a rare entertainment trifecta, and Allen went on to rule the box office with two trilogies: ""The Santa Clause"" (1994, 2002, 2006) and ""Toy Story"" (1995, 1999, 2010). Fans followed him to other projects, too; Allen toplined moneymakers like ""Galaxy Quest"" (1999), ""Christmas with the Kranks"" (2004) and ""Wild Hogs"" (2007), and returned to television with a second hit show, ""Last Man Standing"" (ABC 2011-17). Even as his star momentum slowed, the goodwill Allen built up with his early, supernova-level success seemed to assure the comedian as long a career as he chose."
Annie Potts,"Annie Potts was an American film and TV actress who was best known for her roles in ""Ghostbusters"" (1984), ""Designing Women"" (1986-1993), ""Young Sheldon"" (CBS, 2017- ), and three of the four ""Toy Story"" movies, in which she voiced the role of Bo Peep. Born in Nashville and raised in Kentucky, Potts always dreamt of becoming an actress. She attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri where she first began taking drama courses. After graduating, Potts continued her acting studies with post-graduate work in California. However, Potts's burgeoning acting career was nearly derailed in her early 20s when she and her then husband were involved in a major car accident in New Mexico. Potts survived, thankfully, but broke several bones as a result from the wreck and was laid up for weeks in the hospital. After recovering from the accident, Potts pushed forward with her fledgling acting career. She made her feature film debut in 1978's ""Corvette Summer"" which also starred Mark Hamill, who was fresh off his starring role in the blockbuster ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977). Potts continued nabbing roles throughout the early 1980s but it was her supporting role as a wise-cracking secretary in 1984's ""Ghostbusters"" that really put her on the map. The huge success of ""Ghostbusters"" put Potts into the purview of casting agents seemingly overnight and before long she was appearing in popular 80s films like ""Crimes of Passion"" (1984), ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986), and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1986). Then in 1986 Potts joined the cast of the CBS sitcom ""Designing Women."" She played the role of Mary Jo Shively on the series, which also starred Delta Burke and Dixie Carter. Potts appeared in all 163 episodes of the series, which ended its 7 season run in 1993. Potts' next big role came in 1995 when she was cast as the voice of Bo Peep in the Pixar animated film ""Toy Story"" (1995). Potts reprised her role as Bo Peep in two subsequent ""Toy Story"" sequels, including 2019's ""Toy Story 4."" Potts continued acting regularly in both films and on TV shows well into the 2010s. In 2013 she landed a recurring role on ""The Fosters"" (Freeform, 2013-18). In 2017 she joined the cast of the highly anticipated spin-off series ""Young Sheldon."" The sitcom, which was told from the point-of-view of Sheldon Cooper from ""The Big Bang Theory"" (CBS, 2007-2019) at 9-years-old, was an immediate success, and premiered its third season in the fall of 2019."
Tony Hale,
Keegan-Michael Key,"Though many comedy fans were first introduced to Keegan-Michael Key as a cast member on ""MADtv"" (Fox, 1995-2016), he truly became a household name thanks to his sketch comedy series ""Key and Peele"" (Comedy Central, 2012-15). Born in Southfield, Michigan in 1971 to an African American father and white mother, Key was adopted by parents who, by chance, reflected the same racial makeup. Key would later cite the regular ""code switching"" he engaged in between the two cultures within his family as contributing to his interest in playing different characters. Key eventually earned a bachelor's degree in theater from the University of Detroit Mercy as well as a master's from Pennsylvania State University. He was a mainstage cast member at Detroit's Second City improv theater before relocating to Chicago to join that city's even more prestigious Second City location. After a few years, he made the move to Los Angeles to pursue a career on screen, where he slowly began to accrue credits with appearances on ""ER"" (NBC, 1994-2009) and in the film ""Uncle Nino"" (2002). In 2004, Key was cast on the sketch comedy series ""MADtv"" along with another up-and-coming comedy performer named Jordan Peele. Key played a number of beloved recurring characters on the show such as Eugene Struthers and Coach Hines, and when he left the show in 2009, he and castmate Peele opted to pitch their own series to Comedy Central. ""Key and Peele"" proved both a critical and commercial hit, with Key's regular characters like Luther the Anger Translator becoming pop culture sensations. Key also appeared in recurring roles on ""Fargo"" (FX, 2014-) and ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-2015) at this time, in addition to co-starring with Lennon Parham and Jessica St. Clair on the largely improvised series ""Playing House"" (USA, 2014-17) and making a small but hilariously memorable appearance in the comedy ""Let's Be Cops"" (2014). When ""Key and Peele"" wrapped in 2015, he appeared in the feature film ""Tomorrowland"" (2015) and began providing the voice of American Ranger on the animated series ""SuperMansion"" (Crackle, 2015- ). The next year, Key re-teamed with Peele for the absurdist comedy film ""Keanu"" (2016) and honored his roots as an improvisor with the sleeper hit ""Don't Think Twice"" (2016). Then in 2017, Key began starring on the comedy-drama series ""Friends from College"" (Netflix, 2017-19). Though the show lasted only two seasons, it was a major critical hit, increasing Key's reputation as not just a gifted comedian but a talented actor. He quickly moved forward, co-starring with Eddie Murphy in ""Dolemite is My Name"" (2019) as well as with John Cena in the family comedy ""Playing with Fire"" (2019), as well as reteaming with Peele as a double act in ""Toy Story 4."""
Madeleine McGraw,
Saoirse Ronan,"Considered one of Hollywood's most promising young talents by the age of 13, actress Saoirse Ronan demonstrated a range and depth far beyond her years in several highly-regarded films. After early work on Irish television and a supporting role opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in the romantic-comedy ""I Could Never Be Your Woman"" (2007), Ronan became one of the most talked about actresses of any age when she appeared in ""Atonement"" (2007). Nominated for dozens of awards for her work alongside Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, she was soon racking up more accolades in such eagerly-awaited projects as ""City of Ember"" (2008), ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009) and ""The Way Back"" (2010). With her astonishing turn as a 16-year-old killing machine in the action-thriller ""Hanna"" (2011), Ronan proved she had both the talent and physical presence to tackle roles beyond the abilities of almost any other actress her age. Competing for parts with the likes of Dakota Fanning and compared to such acting luminaries as Meryl Streep, Ronan looked forward to a career as diverse and rewarding as she chose to make it. She adjusted smoothly to more mature roles with films ranging from Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014) to YA dystopia ""The Host"" (2012) before winning two more Oscar nominations with period drama ""Brooklyn"" (2015) and Greta Gerwig's coming of age comedy-drama ""Lady Bird"" (2017) and starring in prestige films such as ""On Chesil Beach"" (2017) and ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2018)."
Laurie Metcalf,"Incredibly versatile and capable of plumbing the depths of even the most complex roles, actress Laurie Metcalf was a critical darling on the stages of Chicago and New York prior to being cast on one of television's most beloved sitcoms of all time. An early member of Chicago's revered Steppenwolf Theater Company, Metcalf garnered widespread critical acclaim for her performance in the troupe's off-Broadway mounting of ""Balm of Gilead"" in 1984. Four years later, the actress became known to mainstream American audiences as Jackie Harris, the melancholy but well-meaning sister of Roseanne Barr's titular matriarch on the hit sitcom ""Roseanne"" (ABC, 1988-1997; 2018- ). The increased visibility led the accomplished actress to appear in several high-profile feature films of the time, including the crime-thriller ""Internal Affairs"" (1990) and director Oliver Stone's explosive docudrama ""JFK"" (1991). Another memorable role for Metcalf came with the voice of Andy's Mom in the Disney/Pixar animated hit film ""Toy Story"" (1995) and its equally popular sequels. Post-""Roseanne,"" she remained a frequent presence on television with memorable recurring roles on popular series like ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" (NBC, 1996-2001), ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC, 2004-2012) and ""The Big Bang Theory"" (CBS, 2007- ), as well as smaller projects like Louis CK's quirky ""Horace and Pete"" (2016). She also co-starred in the dark sitcom ""Getting On"" (HBO 2013-15) and the family sitcom ""The McCarthys"" (CBS 2014-15), burnishing her leading-lady qualities even though neither series lasted very long. Metcalf capped her late-career renaissance with an Oscar-nominated role as the title character's mother in Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" (2017) and a return to the role that made her famous in a reboot of ""Roseanne"" that was retooled as ""The Conners"" (ABC 2018- ) following Roseanne Barr's firing from the series. An actress committed to illuminating the inner-life of her multilayered characters, Metcalf was one of the more esteemed supporting actresses in all mediums."
Lucas Hedges,"Born in Brooklyn Heights, actor Lucas Hedges was the son of Oscar-nominated screenwriter and director Peter Hedges and his wife, Susan Bruce, a poet. Hedges graduated from St. Ann's School in Brooklyn, and later enrolled at University of North Carolina School of the Arts. Hedges' film debut came in 2007 when he appeared in his father's movie, the Steve Carell vehicle ""Dan in Real Life."" Hedges also appeared in Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012), Dante Ariola's ""Arthur Newman"" (2012), Jason Reitman's ""Labor Day"" (2013), and ""The Zero Theorem"" directed by Terry Gilliam. Hedges next appeared in another one of Wes Anderson's films, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014). His breakthrough role came when Hedges appeared in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester-by-the-Sea"" (2016). Playing the nephew of a broken, emotionally crippled man, Hedges was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2017 it was announced that Hedges would appear in ""Lady Bird,"" directed by Greta Gerwig. The same year Hedges made his debut on the stage, in an off-Broadway production of ""Yen,"" written by Anna Jordan and directed by Trip Cullman."
Tracy Letts,"From pulp-inspired crime, to horror, to his own family tragedies, the subject matter of Tracy Letts' plays has been as diverse as the talents of Letts himself. Whether he's penning scripts for the stage and screen or acting, Letts has garnered critical kudos and major awards, as well as mainstream success, beginning with his 1993 play ""Killer Joe,"" and continuing through his work with Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company, film adaptations of his own plays, including ""Bug"" (2006) and ""August: Osage County"" (2013), as well as a Tony Award-winning performance in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"""
Odeya Rush,"Odeya Rush started acting at a young age, but there was a natural progression to her screen career, moving from advertisements to television to movies. At the age of nine Rush relocated from Israel to Alabama with her family (including six brothers). As soon as they arrived in the States, Rush was already telling her family she wanted to be an actress. They moved to New Jersey two years later and Rush was cast in her first print and TV commercials. After they moved to Los Angeles, Rush advanced into TV with guest spots on ""Law & Order: Special Victim Unit"" (NBC, 1999-) and the cult Larry David comedy ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (HBO, 2000-2011). This was followed by her film debut with a 'best friend' role in Disney's ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" (2012), opposite CJ Adams, before featuring in horror remake ""We Are What We Are"" (2013). Rush had to audition six times for her first lead in teen sci-fi adventure ""The Giver"" (2014) -- alongside Meryl Streep, Jeff Bridges and Taylor Swift. The role earned her a Teen Choice Breakout Star Award. In 2015, she landed another lead in the big screen relaunch of R.L. Stine's massively popular family friendly horror series ""Goosebumps,"" playing the daughter of a fantasy version of the popular children's author, portrayed by Jack Black."
Tom Cruise,"Tom Cruise rose quickly to become one of the best-known American actors in the world. Born in Syracuse, New York, he moved around throughout his childhood, including a period in Canada. After graduating from high school in New Jersey, he moved first to New York and then to Los Angeles to pursue acting. He made his film debut in the Brooke Shields vehicle ""Endless Love"" (1981). His next role as an aggressive military cadet opposite Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn in ""Taps"" (1981) caught people's attention. He joined another group of young stars, including Patrick Swayze and Rob Lowe, in Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of the S.E. Hinton novel ""The Outsiders"" (1983). His starring role as schoolboy-turned-pimp Joel in ""Risky Business"" broke him as one of Hollywood's newest celebrities. The long shoot schedule of Ridley Scott's fantasy epic ""Legend"" (1985) briefly took him out of the public eye, but he bounced back with one of the iconic roles of the 1980s. Playing Navy fighter pilot Maverick in Tony Scott's ""Top Gun"" (1986) turned Cruise into a superstar. He began branching into roles with more heft at the same time when he joined Paul Newman for ""The Color of Money"" (1986). He continued in that vein during the next several years, working with high profile directors and co-stars in prestige projects. He partnered with Dustin Hoffman for ""Rain Man"" (1988), Oliver Stone for ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989), and Jack Nicholson for ""A Few Good Men"" (1993), the first two of which were Oscar-winners for Best Picture. The actor picked up his first Academy Award nomination for ""Born on the Fourth of July."" While it didn't garner the same level of critical acclaim, his role as Anne Rice's vampire Lestat opposite a young Brad Pitt in ""Interview with a Vampire"" (1994) became as well-remembered as any of the actor's roles. His 11-year marriage to Nicole Kidman saw the couple partner on three films including Ron Howard's ""Far and Away"" (1992) and Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999). By the '90s, he had his pick of roles and began mixing in big-budget populist fare like ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), based on the '60s television show of the same name. His role as secret agent Ethan Hunt proved popular enough for a series of sequels that would extend for more than two decades. Cruise also notched a second Oscar nomination for his role as a sports agent gaining a conscious in Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996). He worked with another rising filmmaker when he played motivational speaker Frank Mackey in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" (1999), a role that earned him another Academy Award nomination. After the turn of the century, Cruise bounced between effects-heavy fare like ""Minority Report"" (2002) and ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) to dramas such as ""Lions for Lambs"" (2007) with Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. He also proved himself willing to puncture his own inflated image, with comedic cameos in ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" (2002) and ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), and his musical turn in ""Rock of Ages"" (2012). He similarly adopted a self-effacing posture when fans began noticing that there was a scene of the actor running in nearly all his films. Over the years, he found himself a magnet for the tabloids thanks to his close ties to the Church of Scientology and his celebrity marriages to Kidman and Katie Holmes. Cruise added another action franchise to his resume when he jumped into the role of Lee Child's literary tough guy ""Jack Reacher"" (2012). He would reprise the role in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016). After starring in the big-budget reboot of ""The Mummy"" (2017) and the drama ""American Made"" (2017), he returned to the role that once cemented his superstar status. More than 20 years after the original, Cruise climbed back into the cockpit to revive Maverick for a sequel to his 1986 hit ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2020)."
Henry Cavill,"British actor Henry Cavill rose to fame in 2013 as the screen incarnation of Superman in ""Man of Steel,"" and reprised the character on several occasions while also providing brawn and gravitas for such hits as ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (2015) and ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018). Born Henry William Dalgliesh Cavill on May 5, 1983 on Jersey, the largest of England's Channel Islands, he began his education at St. Michael's Preparatory School on Jersey before crossing the Channel to attend the Stowe School, a private boarding school near the town of Buckingham, England. He was initially drawn to ancient history, which he hoped to study at university through an armed services scholarship. But a chance encounter with Russell Crowe, who filmed ""Proof of Life"" (2000) at the school, inspired Cavill to turn his interests toward acting, which he pursued through school productions. By chance, a casting director visited Stowe in search of a young actor to play Guy Pearce's son in Kevin Reynolds' version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (2002), and chose Cavill for his looks and relative acting experience. Roles in high-profile British films, including ""I Capture the Castle"" (2003), followed, but within a few years, these had given way to low-budget or largely unseen projects, like Reynolds' ""Tristan and Isolde"" (2006). Cavill had also earned a reputation for missing out on major projects, including two that went to Robert Pattinson - ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005) and ""Twilight"" (2008) - as well as James Bond in ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and ironically, Superman in what would become ""Superman Returns"" (2006). He busied himself instead with supporting turns in Woody Allen's ""Whatever Works"" (2009) and a recurring role as the first Duke of Suffolk on Showtime's historical drama series ""The Tudors"" (BBC Two/CBC Television, 2007-2010). A turn as the mythological hero Theseus in Tarsem Singh's ""Immortals"" (2011) reconfirmed Cavill's knack for physical roles, which in turn put him back in the spotlight for the Superman film franchise. He assumed the cape for Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" (2013) - with his acting inspiration Russell Crowe as Superman's birth father, Jor-El - and reprised the D.C. Comics hero in two more films, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016), with Ben Affleck as the Caped Crusader, and ""Justice League"" (2017), which added Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Between these special effects-fueled epics, Cavill played '60s TV super-spy Napoleon Solo in a big-screen adaptation of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" and played a double-crossing agent opposite Tom Cruise in the blockbuster hit ""Mission Impossible - Fallout."" With an array of hits now under his belt, Cavill divided his time between television, playing a monster hunter in the Netflix fantasy series ""The Witcher"" (2019- ) before moving on to another enduring pop culture figure - Sherlock Holmes - in ""Enola Holmes"" with Millie Bobby Brown of ""Stranger Things"" (Netflix, 2016- ) as the consulting detective's younger and equally talented sister."
Ving Rhames,"While actor Ving Rhames won a Golden Globe Award for his starring role as the infamous boxing promoter in ""Don King: Only in America"" (HBO, 1997), he was generally known as a supporting player on the big screen. Rhames' breakout role as crime kingpin Marsellus Wallace in Quentin Tarantino's unexpected cult hit, ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), brought the actor his first major attention, while independent film fans had a taste of his imposing physicality and brooding air in earlier films, including ""The Saint of Fort Washington"" (1993) and David Mamet's ""Homicide"" (1991).  The actor went on to enjoy a steady screen career and continuous acclaim for his multi-dimensional sidekicks, supporting Tom Cruise in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise (1996, 2000, 2006), and giving strong performances in films like ""Out of Sight"" (1998) and ""Con Air"" (1997), where, among his strengths, was lending a philosophical bent to career criminals and imbuing figures of authority with realistic flaws."
Simon Pegg,"British actor, writer and comedian Simon Pegg rose to fame in the United Kingdom as the star of the popular twenty-something slacker sitcom ""Spaced"" (Channel 4, 1999, 2001). Pegg frequently collaborated with other talent from the series, forming a hip new clique of British comedians who eventually found widespread appeal with international audiences. He co-wrote and starred in the adored cult zombie spoof ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), earning a following in the United States that ballooned to full-blown stardom in 2007 with the action-flick send-up, ""Hot Fuzz."" Adding further luster to his cool-factor, Pegg was cast as chief engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott in J.J. Abrams' retelling of the ""Star Trek"" (2009) film franchise, assuring Pegg's jump to celebrity status."
Rebecca Ferguson,"Swedish-English actress Rebecca Ferguson's compelling turn as an English Queen in training in ""The White Queen"" (BBC, 2013) helped to mint her as a star in Hollywood features, including ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" (2015), ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016), ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017) and ""Men in Black: International"" (2019). Born Rebecca Louisa Ferguson Sundström on October 19, 1983 in Stockholm, Sweden, she was raised in a bilingual household - her mother was English and her father was Swedish - in the city's Vasastan district. Ferguson began her career in front of cameras in her early teens, first as a model for print publications and later, in television commercials for cosmetics and fashion accessories. After graduating from Adolf Fredrik's Music School in 1999, the 16-year-old Ferguson earned her breakout role as an upper-class teenager on the soap opera ""Nya tider"" (TV, 1999-2006). She left the series after a year and joined the cast of another soap, a Swedish-American series filmed in the United States called ""Ocean Ave.""(TV4, 2002-2003), which received poor reviews; Ferguson then retreated to the coastal town of Simirishamn, where she gave birth to a son with then-boyfriend Ludwig Hallberg in 2007. She remained largely off-screen until 2011, when director Richard Hobert spotted her at the town's market and asked her to appear in his upcoming film, ""A One-Way Trip to Antibes"" (2011). Ferguson was cast as Maria, a duplicitous maid who is blackmailed by elderly widower Sven-Bertil Taube into foiling his children's plan to steal his life savings. She soon returned to steady work on screen, first in Scandinavian features like the drama ""Us"" (2013), and then in English-language projects, beginning in 2013 with ""The White Queen,"" which cast her as commoner turned 15th-century English Queen consort Elizabeth Woodville. Her performance earned a Golden Globe nomination and led to more projects in the UK and United States, though none more high-profile than ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,"" for which she starred as Ilsa Faust, an icy operative connected to a criminal organization. Star Tom Cruise chose Ferguson for the role based on her performance in ""The White Queen,"" and the global success of the film led to starring roles in the spy thriller ""Despite the Falling Snow"" (2016), as Hugh Grant's mistress in the comic biopic ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" (2016), as Justin Theroux's wife and one of several objects of unhealthy fixation by Emily Blunt in ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016), and as a doomed scientist in the 2017 science fiction thriller ""Life"" (2017). Ferguson's run of roles in major features continued unabated in the years that followed: she played singer Jenny Lind in the musical ""The Greatest Showman"" and reprised her turn as Ilsa Faust in ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018), while also lining up prominent roles in ""Men in Black: International,"" ""Doctor Sleep"" (2020) - the sequel to Stephen King's ""The Shining"" - and Denis Villeneuve's epic adaptation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" (2020)."
Sean Harris,"Nervy, sharp-featured Londoner Sean Harris brings a feral intensity to his roles, and he has consequently come to specialize in outsiders, ranging from the hellishly violent to the merely twitchy. Raised in Norfolk and trained at London's Drama Centre, Harris appeared as Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis in Michael Winterbottom's much-admired chronicle of the Manchester music scene, ""24 Hour Party People."" In 2004's ""Creep,"" he played a monster living in the London Underground. As if that wasn't dark enough, he embodied a real-life monster, Moors murderer Ian Brady, in the BAFTA-winning TV serial ""See No Evil: The Moors Murders,"" and played a violent former football hooligan involved in a campaign of vigilante violence in Nick Love's underground hit ""Outlaw."" Harris is a regular presence in uncommercial but critically lauded British films, such as the surreal mockumentary ""Brothers of the Head,"" David Mackenzie's dark drama ""Asylum,"" and the oddball thriller ""Saxon,"" in which he played a rare lead role. He played the key role of murder victim Fred Hale in Rowan Joffe's ""Brighton Rock,"" worked with Sir Michael Caine on ""Harry Brown,"" and appears amid a starry cast in Ridley Scott's sci-fi epic ""Prometheus/b. Further TV work includes the Channel 4 serial killer drama ""Red Riding,"" and Neil Jordan's ""The Borgias."""
John David Washington,"The son of Academy Award winner Denzel Washington, John David Washington was born in Toluca Lake, California in 1984. Aside from a small role in ""Malcolm X"" (1992), starring his father in the title role, the younger Washington avoided the glitz and glamour of the Hollywood spotlight, instead focusing his attention on athletics. After lettering in football, baseball, and track at Campbell Hall High School in Los Angeles, Washington attended his father's alma mater, Morehouse College, on a football scholarship. As a running back at Morehouse, he set school records for yards in a career, season, and single game and led his conference in rushing in 2005. Undrafted in the 2006 draft, Washington was signed by the St. Louis Rams, eventually ending up on their practice squad. After stints in the NFL Europe and the short-lived United Football League, Washington finally came back to Hollywood, first as a co-producer on ""The Book of Eli"" (2010) starring his father and directed by Allen and Albert Hughes. Washington's first professional work in front of the camera during his adult life came in 2015 when he landed a role as a series regular on ""Ballers"" (HBO, 2015-). On the show he plays Ricky Jerret, a cocky wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, with Dwayne Johnson playing his agent."
Adam Driver,"Adam Driver really lived up to his last name. An occasional theatre performer and singer in his suburban Indiana high school, the intense but directionless Driver signed up for the Marines shortly after 9/11 and spent nearly three years training for overseas combat before being honorably discharged. After graduating from the famed Juilliard School, Driver brought his darkly magnetic presence to a string of minor TV appearances and landed small roles in HBO's Dr. Kevorkian biopic ""You Don't Know Jack"" (2010) and the lumbering ""J. Edgar"" (2011). But it was his performance on the buzzy, bruising ""Girls"" (HBO, 2012-17) as Adam Sackler, Lena Dunham's emotionally complicated boyfriend, that brought him into the spotlight. Big-screen roles in Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" (2012), the Coen Brothers' folk-scene homage ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (2013), and Noah Baumbach's indie hit ""Frances Ha"" (2012) ensured he stayed there. While his nuanced performance as Kylo Ren in the much-anticipated ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015) and ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017) brought Driver to a whole new level of international superstardom, his work in smaller films like Jim Jarmusch's ""Paterson"" (2016), Baumbach's ""The Meyerowitz Stories"" (2017), Steven Soderbergh's ""Logan Lucky"" (2017) and Spike Lee's ""Black Klansman"" (2018) kept him true to his indie roots. In between films, Driver co-founded Arts in the Armed Forces, a non-profit organization that staged theatrical and musical performances for members of the military."
Laura Harrier,"Laura Harrier was an American actress and model who broke out in 2017 when she appeared as Liz in the blockbuster superhero movie ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017). Born in Chicago and raised in Evanston, Illinois, Harrier became an actress by accident. After moving to New York City at 18 to attend NYU, Harrier started working as a professional model. She never saw modeling as a sustainable career path, but before long she was landing work for such high-profile companies as Urban Outfitters and American Eagle. Eventually, Harrier decided to drop out of NYU to pursue modeling full-time. By her early 20s, Harrier's modeling career was in full-swing and it was around that time that she became interested in acting. Since she was living in New York, Harrier began taking classes at the William Esper studio on a whim. She soon realized that acting was her calling and began devoting more and more time to learning her craft. By the early 2010s Harrier was going out on film and TV auditions and in 2013 landed her first big break with the reboot of ""One Life to Live"" (TOLN, 2013). She played Destiny Evans on the rebooted soap opera, which ran for 43 episodes on The Online Network, before it was cancelled. Undeterred, she continued auditioning and in 2014 landed a small part in the musical-comedy ""The Last Five Years"" (2014). She followed that role up with a role in the comedy-drama ""Fourth Man Out"" in 2015, thus adding another mainstream film role to her growing acting resume. Then in 2017 Harrier nabbed her breakout acting role in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" The blockbuster premiered in the summer of 2017, and also included appearances by Oscar-winners Marisa Tomei and Gwyneth Paltrow."
Topher Grace,"Topher Grace was an American TV and film actor who was best known for playing the affable Eric Forman for 7 seasons on the Fox sitcom ""That 70's Show"" (Fox, 1998-2006). Born in New York City and raised in Darien, Connecticut, Grace first started acting while attending boarding school in New Hampshire. He began appearing in school productions of famous musicals like ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,"" and quickly fell in love with acting. It was also during this period that Grace, whose first name is Christopher, started calling himself Topher, seeing as he hated it when people called him Chris. When he was just starting out as a stage actor, Grace met a young actress by the name of Chloe Sevigny (who would later go on to have a sterling acting career in her own right). Grace and Sevigny appeared in a few plays together, and although she was only a few years older than him, she eventually babysat for the younger Topher on a few occasions. By the time he was 18, Grace knew that he wanted to be in films and on TV. He enrolled in the University of Southern California, given its close proximity to Hollywood, and began going on auditions in between classes. On one of his very first auditions, he was asked to read for the part of a new sitcom that took place in the 1970s. Grace crushed the audition and was given the role of the lovable, but slightly socially awkward teenager Eric Forman on ""That 70's Show."" When the show premiered in 1998, it was a big hit, making instant stars of Grace and his fellow castmates, which included Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. By the early 2000s, with his career in the sitcom world riding high, Grace also started making a name for himself in movies. In the first few years of the 2000s, Grace racked up roles in ""Traffic"" (2000), ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001), ""Mona Lisa Smile"" (2003) and ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"" (2004), thus proving he had the serious acting chops needed to make it in movies. In 2005, after 7 seasons on ""That 70's Show,"" Grace left the series to focus on his burgeoning film career. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, he appeared as Venom in ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007), ""Predators"" (2010), ""Take Me Home Tonight"" (2011), ""The Big Wedding"" (2013), and ""Interstellar"" (2014). Then in 2018, Grace worked with the iconic director Spike Lee in ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018). He played the white supremacist David Duke in the film, which took home an Academy Award and also starred Adam Driver. In 2019, nearly 15 years after he left ""That 70's Show,"" Grace returned to TV with a starring role in the thriller mini-series ""The Hot Zone"" (National Geographic, 2019). That series, which also starred Julianna Margulies, premiered on the National Geographic channel in May of 2019."
Corey Hawkins,"Corey Hawkins blew audiences away with his breakthrough role as legendary rapper Dr. Dre in 2015's ""Straight Outta Compton"" (2015). Born in Washington D.C. in 1988, Hawkins noticed his attraction to performing as a child while attending church with his grandmother, where he enjoyed singing in the congregation's choir. After attending high school at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Hawkins moved to New York for college where he enrolled at Juilliard School, receiving the John Houseman Award for excellence in classical theatre during his studies there. He subsequently began his professional acting career, appearing on an episode of the science fiction series Futurestates (ITVS, 2010-). He moved to the big screen the next year with a role in the action thriller ""Allegiance"" (2012), before making his Broadway debut as Tybalt in a 2013 revival of ""Romeo and Juliet."" He would appear alongside Liam Neeson in the thriller ""Non-Stop"" (2014) soon afterward, with his landmark role in ""Straight Outta Compton"" appearing shortly thereafter. Hawkins next made a move toward TV with a major role on one of the most popular series of the moment, ""The Walking Dead"" (AMC, 2010-). He continued this trend when he was cast as the lead on the series ""24: Legacy: (Fox, 2017-) in 2017."
Daniel Kaluuya,"Born in London, Daniel Kaluuya's career in entertainment started off in a way that became somewhat typical for young British actors in the mid-2000s. He first appeared in the BBC film ""Shoot the Messenger"" (2006) and followed that up with a recurring role on the teen drama ""Skins"" (E4 2007-2013), where he played the role of Posh Kenneth and also joined the writing staff. His notoriety on ""Skins"" led to many TV appearances in England, including guest spots on ""Doctor Who"" (BBC 1963- ) and the crime drama ""Silent Witness"" (BBC 1996- ), and the sketch comedy show ""That Mitchell and Webb Look"" (BBC 2006-2010). While he appeared somewhat regularly on television, Kaluuya also took to the stage, earning acclaim for a number of performances. After a small part in the Rowan Atkinson comedy ""Johnny English Reborn"" (2011), his presence in films started to pick up, as he then broke more into the American mainstream as the villainous Black Death in the comic book film ""Kick-Ass 2"" (2013). He then followed that up with a role as an FBI agent in crime drama ""Sicario"" (2015). At the end of 2016, it was announced he would play the role of W'Kabi in the Marvel film ""Black Panther"" (2018). Shortly after the announcement, the Jordan Peele-directed horror film ""Get Out"" (2017) came out to rave reviews and box office success. Kaluuya received much praise, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, for his breakout performance in the film about an African-American man (Kaluuya) meeting his girlfriend's parents in a small suburban town. Kaluuya was next seen as W'Kabi in the blockbuster superhero film ""Black Panther"" (2018)."
Allison Williams,
Catherine Keener,"Catherine Keener was a solid force in American independent cinema, where she built up a following in films from directors like Tom DiCillo and Nicole Holofcener during the 1990s. The effortless, naturalistic acting style that landed her roles as wry, likable bohemians and stern, archly observed professionals found wider audiences the following decade with diverse offerings like Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"" (2000), Judd Apatow's monster summer comedy ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005), and the gripping period literary drama ""Capote"" (2005). Aging gracefully into maternal roles, Keener continued alternating between lead roles in art house favorites such as Nicole Holofcener's ""Friends With Money"" (2006) and David Schwimmer's ""Trust"" (2010) and supporting roles in hits ranging from animated smash ""The Croods"" (2013) to Jordan Peele's horror hit ""Get Out"" (2017). For an actress with a dedication to interesting, well-developed female characters, Keener managed to beat the odds and maintain a steady presence in movie theaters as the go-to actress for vanity-free portraits of real women with relatable quirks and foibles."
Bradley Whitford,"Though originally a supporting player in various film and television projects, actor Bradley Whitford emerged as an Emmy Award-winning lead performer on the critically acclaimed political drama, ""The West Wing"" (NBC, 1999-2006). Prior to his seven season run on that beloved program, Whitford made a small name for himself, usually as an arrogant yuppie type in films like ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987) and ""Billy Madison"" (1995). He also excelled on the stage, delivering standout performances in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1988) and in the original production of ""A Few Good Men"" (1989), which introduced the actor to ""The West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin. In fact, Whitford became something of a Sorkin player, returning to star in the writer-playwright's critically acclaimed, but ultimately failed drama about the goings-on of a flailing late night sketch show, ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" (NBC, 2006-07). Whitford continued working steadily, starring on the sitcom ""Trophy Wife"" (ABC 2013-14) and appearing in the acclaimed comedy-drama ""Transparent"" (Amazon 2014- ), co-starring as Hubert Humphrey in the television movie ""All the Way"" (HBO 2015) and co-starring in Jordan Peele's critically-acclaimed horror hit ""Get Out"" (2017). Always one to talk about his political views, which were firmly planted on the liberal side of the spectrum, Whitford was often called upon to express his opinions on talk shows like ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" (HBO, 2003- ) and even co-host a radio talk show on Air America. But his bread-and-butter remained being a strong character actor who could also excel as a prominent leading man."
Caleb Landry Jones,
Marcus Henderson,
Tom Hardy,"Tom Hardy set tongues wagging in the U.K. with raw-nerved performances in ""Stuart: A Life Backwards"" (BBC, 2007) and ""Bronson"" (2009), and in the U.S. as well with a scene-stealing performance in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi blockbuster, ""Inception"" (2010). With this trifecta of projects, he found himself vaulted from rising U.K. heartthrob to Hollywood breakout-star-in-the-making. A native of suburban London, Hardy stumbled through an adolescence of recidivist juvenile delinquency and drug addiction to channel his energies into drama. He won some high-profile early acting jobs, seeing his first major screen time in the youthful ensemble of the epic HBO miniseries, ""Band of Brothers"" (2001), and turning in an intense performance as the intergalactic villain in ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002). A crack cocaine habit nearly derailed his career, but upon sobering up, he served notice he was a dramatic force to be reckoned with, winning raves and awards for his 2003 performances in the West End productions of ""In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings"" and ""Blood."" He won the romantic lead of the Earl of Leicester in the 2005 BBC miniseries ""The Virgin Queen,"" the first of a series of critically lauded prestige television projects that would include ""Stuart: A Life Backwards"" and classic film remakes ""A for Andromeda"" (BBC, 2006), ""Oliver Twist"" (BBC, 2007) and ""Wuthering Heights"" (ITV, 2009). He would show a distinct penchant for playing tough guys in U.K.-produced indie features such as Guy Richie's ""RocknRolla"" (2008) before his hilarious turn as a dream-walking thief in ""Inception"" put him on the fast-track to higher-profile films, including Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012), George Miller's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015), London criminal underworld drama ""Legend"" (2015), Alejandro González Iñárritu's philosophical thriller ""The Revenant"" (2016) and Nolan's World War II drama ""Dunkirk"" (2017). A sinewy ball of thespian intensity, Hardy earned his growing renown not only as a simmering bad boy, but as a ferociously charismatic leading man."
Charlize Theron,"Charlize Theron refused to take the easy path to Hollywood success and in the process crafted one of the most successful careers in film history. Born in South Africa, she originally moved with her mother to Milan, Italy to accept a modeling contract when she was 16. She relocated again to the United States to study dance. After an injury derailed her dancing career, she moved again to Los Angeles, and began an acting career. A small role as a lingerie-clad assassin in ""2 Days in the Valley"" (1996) brought her immediate notice. She was cast by Tom Hanks in ""That Thing You Do!"" (1997) and in the comedy ""Trial and Error"" (1997), before progressing quickly into high profile starring roles. Playing opposite Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino, she gained notice in Taylor Hackford's ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997), as the possessed wife of Reeves' lawyer. She soon headlined her own film when she was cast as the lead in Disney's remake of ""Mighty Joe Young"" (1998). She continued working steadily, starring opposite Tobey Maguire in ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999) and Ben Affleck in the action film ""Reindeer Games"" (2000), but she began slotting into roles that played upon her fresh-faced beauty. After a role in the well-received action yarn ""The Italian Job"" (2003), she took a role that completely changed perceptions of her. As serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Patty Jenkins' ""Monster"" (2003), the actress undertook a transformation that left her almost unrecognizable. She earned critical praise for the role, and took home both an Oscar and a Golden Globe. She followed up with dramatic roles in ""Head in the Cloud"" (2004) and ""North Country"" (2005), picking up a second Academy Award nomination for the latter. Despite good reviews the films didn't make quite the same impression as ""Monster."" Similarly, her work in the effects heavy films ""Aeon Flux"" (2005) and ""Hancock"" (2008), with Will Smith, also fell short of expectations. The actress fared better with a brief foray into television with a memorable guest arc on the hit comedy ""Arrested Development"" (Fox, 2003-06) and appearing as actress Britt Ekland opposite Geoffrey Rush in ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" (HBO, 2004).. She began another upward ascent with a role opposite Viggo Mortensen in the adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic drama ""The Road"" (2009). A fruitful partnership with screenwriter Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman emerged soon after, resulting in the well-received ""Young Adult"" (2011). The trio would later reform for ""Tully"" (2018). She also joined Chris Hemsworth for the fantasy adventures ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016), playing sinister fairy tale villain Queen Ravenna. Her action bona fides were proven conclusively when she starred in George Miller's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015), where she played the road warrior Imperator Furiosa. She followed that with a showy role as special agent Lorraine Broughton in ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017). The actress also joined one of history's most successful film franchises, playing the villainous Cipher in ""The Fate of the Furious"" (2017) and ""Fast & Furious 9"" (2020). Never one to be pigeonholed, she continued working in comedy as well, starring with Seth MacFarlane in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" (2014) and Seth Rogen in the romantic comedy ""Longshot"" (2019), the latter of which was under the banner of her own production company."
Nicholas Hoult,"British actor Nicholas Hoult seamlessly made the transition from child star into one of the top actors of his generation. A native of Workingham in England, he began acting in stage productions while still a toddler. His screen debut came at the age of five when he was cast in Philip Goodhew's ""Intimate Relations"" (1996). He began appearing regularly on television, notching guest roles on shows like ""Silent Witness"" (BBC, 1996- ) and ""Doctors"" (BBC, 2000- ). At 11, he found himself in an international hit when he played Marcus in the big screen adaptation of Nick Hornsby's novel ""About a Boy"" (2002). The film, which co-starred Hugh Grant and Toni Collette, was a critical and box office success. In his teens, he appeared as Tony Stonem in the youth drama ""Skins"" (E4,  2007-13) for two seasons. He also appeared in actor Richard E. Grant's semi-autobiographical film ""Wah-Wah"" (2005) and as Nicholas Cage's son in ""The Weather Man"" (2005). He began moving into more adult roles when he was cast in the remake of the fantasy film ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010). He gained notice throughout the film industry when he appeared as the gay college student helping Colin Firth's professor deal with the loss of his longtime companion in ""A Single Man"" (2009).  He soon found himself immersed in the blockbuster superhero genre when he signed on to play Hank McCoy (aka Beast) in ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011). Acting alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy, he would reprise the role in three subsequent films, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014), ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016), and ""Dark Phoenix"" (2019). Apart from playing the Marvel mutant hero, he starred in the fantasy adventure ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" (2013) and appeared with Charlize Theron in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015). With his blockbuster bona fides secure, he began seeking work in smaller films. He took to playing real life legends, starring as reclusive author J.D. Salinger in ""Rebel in the Rye"" (2017), inventor Nikola Tesla in ""The Current War"" (2017), and ""Lord of the Rings"" author J.R.R. Tolkien in ""Tolkien"" (2019). Teaming with Rachel Weisz (whom he had worked with as a child on ""About a Boy""), Emma Stone, and Olivia Colman, he appeared as Robert Harley, the Earl of Oxford, in the Oscar-winning period drama ""The Favourite"" (2018).  Continuing to expand his resume, he joined the cast of Taylor Sheridan's thriller ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" (2020), alongside Angelina Jolie and Tyler Perry."
Hugh Keays-Byrne,
Josh Helman,"When Josh Helman's professional acting career started up at the age of 21, it wasn't assumed that this Australian actor would make a smooth transition to American cinema despite the hopes of a Mel Gibson-like transition. His debut role was on the Australian soap opera ""Home and Away"" (Seven Network 1988- ) in 2007. After a five-episode run, Helman appeared in a few more Australian projects, including the Oscar-nominated crime thriller ""Animal Kingdom"" (2010) and a guest appearance on the long-running Australian TV show ""McLeod's Daughters"" (Nine Network 2001-09). After that, Helman began to make his way to America, first with the Steven Spielberg-produced mini-series ""The Pacific"" (HBO 2010), a war epic in which he appeared in five episodes. Soon after, he was cast across from Tom Cruise in ""Jack Reacher"" (2012) and appeared as young William Stryker in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014). At that same time, he still was involved in Australian film, appearing in the Australian rules football drama ""Blinder"" (2013) in between his roles on ""Jack Reacher"" and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" He even managed to find a way to blend his Australian roots with his American dreams with an appearance in the follow-up to the cult classic Australian film franchise Mad Max in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015) as the character Slit. Helman also costarred in the dramatic mini-series ""Flesh and Bone"" (Starz 2015), created by ""Breaking Bad"" writer/producer  Moira Walley-Beckett."
Nathan Jones,"Nathan Jones is an an actor who began his entertainment career at the young age of 11. He also starred in the TV movies ""Reunion""  (CBS, 1980-81) and ""Doom Runners""  (Showtime, 1997-98). He also worked in film during these years, including roles in the Jackie Chan action movie ""First Strike""  (1997). He continued to act in productions like the Brad Pitt smash hit adventure ""Troy""  (2004), the action flick ""Jet Li's Fearless""  (2006) with Jet Li and the action film ""The Protector""  (2006) with Tony Jaa. He also appeared in ""The Condemned""  (2007) with Stone Cold Steve Austin. Recently, he continued to act in the comedy adventure ""Asterix at the Olympic Games""  (2008) with Alain Delon, ""Conan the Barbarian""  (2011) and ""Tekken""  (2011). He also appeared in ""Charlie's Farm""  (2015). Jones most recently acted in the Tom Hardy smash hit action picture ""Mad Max: Fury Road""  (2015)."
Shameik Moore,"Rocketing to instant celebrity with his breakout role in the independent hit ""Dope"" (2015), Shameik Moore first began his career as a dancer. Born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1995, Moore was just 12 when he began releasing dance and choreography videos on YouTube, and was participating in Atlanta's ""Dance Invasion"" showcase by his teens. Soon, he was appearing as a dancer in music videos such as Soulja Boy's ""Tell'em (Bird Walk)"" and Keri Hilson's ""Turnin Me On."" In 2011, he made his first foray into television, appearing on an episode of ""House of Payne"" (TBS, 2006-). He moved into feature films with a small part in ""Joyful Noise"" (2012) the following year, before joining the cast of the kids sketch comedy series ""Incredible Crew"" (Cartoon Network, 2012-13). He would make another big screen appearance in the family film ""The Watsons Go to Birmingham"" (2013) before his big break came with 2015's ""Dope."" Playing a nerdy kid with an obsession for '90s hip hop, Moore became an overnight celebrity thanks to the film's overwhelming response at the Sundance Film Festival. Moore's string of success would continue when he was cast in Baz Luhrmann's series ""The Get Down"" (Netflix, 2016-), a show about a group of teens living in the late '70s Bronx amidst the burgeoning hip hop scene."
Jake Johnson,
Hailee Steinfeld,"Like actress Kim Darby, teenager Hailee Steinfeld was raised from relative obscurity to overnight stardom by playing Mattie Ross, the strong-willed frontier girl who hired aging marshal Rooster Cogburn to avenge her father's death in ""True Grit,"" a film originally made in 1969 and starring John Wayne. Age 13 at the time of her casting in the Coen Brothers' 2010 remake, Steinfeld wowed audiences with the strength of her confident performance, which earned numerous critical awards and nominations, as well as predictions of stardom to come. Born Dec. 11, 1996 in Thousand Oaks, CA, Hailee Steinfeld knew that she wanted to be an actress from a very young age. She had fallen in love with the craft after seeing a neighbor perform in a play, and became further enamored after her cousins began making appearances in television commercials. However, Steinfeld's parents insisted that she attend acting classes before they would consider booking her an agent to pursue her career goals. Her family held to their promise, and Steinfeld began landing roles in television commercials and short films. Her all-American looks and natural poise made her a natural for idealized young women, including an angel in the short ""Heather: A Fairy Tale"" (2008) and a dream girl worthy of sacrificing a beloved mullet in ""She's a Fox"" (2009). When directors Joel and Ethan Coen began searching for the young protagonist for their remake of ""True Grit"" (1969), they envisioned an unknown who could make the role her own, a la Tatum O'Neal in ""Paper Moon"" (1973) or Linda Manz in ""Days of Heaven"" (1978). After traveling across the Southwest and auditioning some 5,000 actresses, they found Steinfeld in Los Angeles, and cast her within a week of meeting her. Days later, she was on a plane to Texas to begin filming. Reviewers on the whole agreed with the Coens' choice for their young heroine. Steinfeld received rave reviews for her spirited performance, as well as three Best Supporting Actress awards and a score of nominations from state and national film critic associations. In December of 2010, she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Female Actor in a Supporting Role, and a month later, an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. After some time away from screen work, Steinfeld returned in 2013 with a number of projects. She starred as Juliet opposite fellow actor-on-the-rise Douglas Booth in a feature adaptation of William Shakespeare's perennially performed romantic tragedy ""Romeo & Juliet"" and portrayed the key character of Petra Arkanian in the sci-fi adventure ""Ender's Game,"" based on the Orson Scott Card novel and starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. This was followed by roles in McG's action thriller ""Three Days to Kill"" (2014), Tommy Lee Jones' western ""The Homesman"" (2014) and thriller ""The Keeping Room"" (2014). After joining the cast of comedy sequel ""Pitch Perfect 2"" (2015), (During this period, Steinfeld also embarked on a brief career as a teen pop singer, scoring a Top 40 hit with the 2015 single ""Love Myself."") Steinfeld starred in action comedy ""Barely Lethal"" (2015) and coming of age comedy-drama ""The Edge of Seventeen"" (2016). Along with roles in ""Pitch Perfect 3"" (2017) and animated blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018), Steinfeld next starred in the 1980s-set ""Transformers"" (2007) prequel ""Bumblebee"" (2018)."
Mahershala Ali,"Mahershala Ali was born Mahershalalhashbaz Gilmore on Feb. 16, 1974 in Oakland, CA. He enrolled in St. Mary's College of California on a basketball scholarship, but his passions switched from athletics to acting over the course of his tenure. Following graduation, Ali earned an apprenticeship at the California Shakespeare Theater, and then pursued a Master's degree in acting at New York University. One of Ali's earliest professional roles was that of Dr. Trey Sanders on the series ""Crossing Jordan"" (NBC 2001-07), shortly after which he starred on ""The 4400"" (USA 2004-07) as Richard Tyler. Around this time, Ali experimented with a rapping career, releasing the album Curb Side Service (2007) under the stage name Prince Ali. Ali then pursued acting on the big screen; one of his earliest major roles was in David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008), which he followed up with parts in the likes of ""Crossing Over"" (2009) and ""Predators"" (2010). Back on television, Ali lent his talents to ""Treme"" (HBO 2010-13) and ""House of Cards"" (Netflix 2013-), keeping one foot in the realm of cinema for the likes of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2012) and ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" (2014) and ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2"" (2015) all the while. His name really began to accrue attention as time went on; Ali earned his first ever Oscar nomination and victory thanks to his supporting role in ""Moonlight"" (2016), in which he played a kindhearted drug dealer and the surrogate father to a young boy hiding his homosexuality. That same year, Ali costarred on the superhero series ""Luke Cage"" (Netflix, 2016-18) as villain Cottonmouth Stokes. Two years later, Ali starred in the dramatic film ""Green Book"" (2018) and lent his voice to the animated movie ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018).

Brian Tyree Henry,"Brian Tyree Henry was an American actor who got his start on the stage. After he auditioned for a production of Come and Gone at Morehouse College and landed the lead part, he quit his business major to focus on acting. Henry ended up graduating from the Yale School of Drama with a Masters in Acting in 2007 and performed in various stage and Off-Broadway productions in the years following. He even portrayed Tybalt in a Shakespeare in the Park production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Oscar Isaac, who played Romeo. In 2009, Henry made his TV debut in an episode of ""Law and Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010), then followed it up with an appearance on ""The Good Wife"" (CBS, 2009-2016) in 2010.

He next portrayed recurring character Tavis Brown on the Danny McBride and Walton Goggins comedy ""Vice Principals"" (HBO, 2016- ) and starred on Donald Glover's ""Atlanta"" (FX, 2016) as aspiring rapper Alfred ""Paper Boi"" Miles."
Lily Tomlin,"With an illustrious career that spanned decades on stage and screen beginning in the 1960s, academic-minded actress-comedian Lily Tomlin found a penchant for mimicry and social commentary that wove its way into the fabric of American culture. After making her debut on ""The Garry Moore Show"" (CBS, 1950-1967), Tomlin made a splash on ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In"" (NBC, 1968-1973), particularly as the nasal-voiced telephone operator Ernestine. She went on to become a Grammy-winning recording artist for her comedy album, This Is a Recording (1972), while also starring in and co-writing three primetime television specials, each of which won Emmy Awards. Tomlin made her feature film debut as a troubled gospel singer in Robert Altman's landmark ""Nashville"" (1975) before appearing on Broadway for the first time in her one-woman show, ""Appearing Nightly"" (1977), which she co-wrote with life partner Jane Wagner.  She skyrocketed to superstardom opposite Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton in the hit comedy ""9 to 5"" (1980), while her one-woman show, ""The Search for Intelligent Life in the Universe"" (1986), earned Tomlin a Tony Award. On television, she delivered an acclaimed performance in ""And the Band Played On"" (HBO, 1993), while giving inspired performances in ""Short Cuts"" (1993) and ""Flirting with Disaster"" (1996).  Tomlin remained capable of turning in acclaimed and often unexpected performances more than five decades into her career, and was rewarded with a mid-2010s resurgence that included a critically-acclaimed situation comedy and her first starring role in over a quarter-century in Paul Weitz's ""Grandma"" (2015)."

Ashton Sanders,"Relative newcomer Ashton Sanders made an extraordinary debut as a young black teenager struggling with his sexuality in Barry Jenkins' critical hit ""Moonlight"" (2016). Born October 24, 1995 in Los Angeles, he was raised in the city of Carson and endured a childhood similar to that of his ""Moonlight"" role. Like Chiron, he was bullied by peers throughout elementary and middle school, and was raised by other individuals while his parents grappled with substance abuse issues. He found solace in performance at the Amazing Grace Conservatory, an arts program based in South Central Los Angeles, which convinced him to pursue acting as a career. Sanders made his screen debut at the age of 15 in ""The Retrieval"" (2013), an independent historical drama about a young African-American boy in the Civil War South who is sent to help capture a former slave that he befriended. He then logged a minor role in ""Straight Outta Compton"" before enrolling in DePaul University's esteemed theater program. While there, he received the script for ""Moonlight,"" and was cast as the teenaged Chiron, who endures physical and emotional abuse from all corners of his life, including his mother (Naomie Harris) and the object of his affection (Jharrel Jerome). Sanders' performance was praised by critics, and earned numerous accolades, including two individual acting nominations from the Black Reel Awards and ensemble laurels from the Independent Spirit and Gotham Awards."
Trevante Rhodes,"Trevante Rhodes was an American actor born in Ponchatoula, Louisiana on February 10, 1990. He and his family moved to the Austin, Texas area when he was about ten, and he attended the University of Texas. Rhodes found great success as a sprinter in track and field events, and even helped the United States squad win gold at the 2009 Pan American Junior Athletics Championship. After graduating from UT, Rhodes started to work as an actor, making his film debut in a short film called ""I Came Back"" (2012). His next role, an uncredited passing appearance in the Elijah Wood-led horror film ""Open Windows"" (2014), preceded his television debut in an unnamed appearance on the short-lived drama ""Gang Related"" (Fox, 2014). Rhodes starred in what was his largest role yet in the independent comedy ""The Night Is Young"" (2015) the next year, then landed a recurring cast role as Ramsey Walters on Tyler Perry's primetime soap opera ""If Loving You Is Wrong"" (OWN, 2015-16). 2016 proved to be Rhodes' breakout role, as he played roles in two of the year's most high-profile and critically lauded productions. He starred as the adult Chiron in the epic life-spanning story of heartbreak and romance, ""Moonlight"" (2016); Rhodes was praised for his performance, with many critics naming it his breakout appearance. He also made an appearance in an episode of highly-anticipated science fiction drama ""Westworld"" (HBO, 2016- )."
Gal Gadot,"Gal Gadot managed to successfully combine both modeling and acting after being cast in a series of blockbuster movies. Born in Rosh HaAyin, Israel, she was crowned Miss Israel in 2004. Due to conscription, Israeli citizens over the age of 18 are required to spend time in the army. Gadot spent her time split between modeling and the military, drawing international attention when she featured in Maxim's ""Women of the Israeli Army"" feature in 2007. That same year she made her acting debut on Israeli TV series ""Bubot"" (2007-08). However it was 2009 where she really made an impact when she was cast as Gisele in the fourth installment of the box-office phenomenon ""Fast & Furious."" In keeping with her military training, she also performed her own stunts. This was followed by smaller roles in the comedy series ""Entourage"" (HBO, 2004-2011), ""Date Night"" (2010) and ""Knight and Day"" (2010) before returning to the fold for ""Fast Five"" in 2011. She also found time to front several major advertising campaigns for fashion label Castro, Captain Morgan rum and Jaguar alongside a recurring role on Israeli comedy series ""Asfur"" (2010-2011). ""Fast & Furious 6"" (2013) saw Gadot return as Gisele, though it was her final go-round in the series. Dec. 4, 2013 saw the biggest announcement of Gadot's career so far when she was named as the new Wonder Woman, set to appear in ""Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) before the comic book superstar finally made her headlining debut in the long-delayed ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), co-starring Chris Pine and directed by Patty Jenkins.  The film was a massive critical and box office success, with Gadot's performance singled out by criticas and audiences alike. Gadot next appeared as Wonder Woman in the ensemble film ""Justice League"" (2017). As that film was released during a massive wave of publicity about sexual misconduct in Hollywood, Gadot made headlines by saying that she would not appear in the scheduled ""Wonder Woman 2"" unless producer Brett Ratner, whose career had been shadowed by misconduct allegations, was removed from the project."
Chris Pine,
Connie Nielsen,"A talented actress whose formidable onscreen persona saw her specializing in cool, competent women, Connie Nielsen was more interested in honing her craft than in becoming a celebrity. The Danish actress received her start in French and Italian projects, but broke through internationally with a small role as Al Pacino's evil temptress sidekick in ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997). She notched memorable supporting roles in ""Rushmore"" (1998), ""Soldier"" (1998) and ""Mission to Mars"" (2000) before landing the female lead of the Oscar-winning ""Gladiator"" (2000) opposite Russell Crowe. Her searing turn as the proud-but-powerless Lucilla, older sister of the corrupt emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) earned her raves, and she used her newfound fame to springboard into art house films with leading roles in the Robin Williams thriller ""One Hour Photo"" (2002) and the challenging ""Demonlover"" (2002). Nielsen won the Danish equivalent of the Oscar for her starring role in the drama ""Brødre"" (""Brothers"") (2004), which was remade into an American film in 2009. Consistently cast as tough, powerful women, Nielsen memorably filled in during the maternity leave of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" (NBC, 1999- ) star Mariska Hargitay and co-starred in political drama ""Boss"" (Starz 2011-12) and Kevin Bacon serial killer drama ""The Following"" (Fox 2013-15), while co-starring in films as varied as Lars von Trier's controversial ""Nymphomaniac"" (2013) and comic book blockbuster ""Wonder Woman"" (2017). Almost too talented a chameleon, Nielsen disappeared so completely into her characters that she never achieved widespread mainstream fame, but was universally hailed for the gravity she brought to every performance."
Robin Wright,"Actress Robin Wright's sunny California girl appearance belied a fierce, discerning talent, displayed in her impressive array of film roles, including starring in two of the most beloved movies of all time. After receiving her start on the daytime soap opera ""Santa Barbara"" (NBC, 1983-1994) as fan favorite Kelly Capwell, Wright broke out in the role of the defiant Princess Buttercup in director Rob Reiner's instant family classic ""The Princess Bride"" (1987). She began a rocky two-decade relationship with Sean Penn after co-starring with the tempestuous actor in the crime drama ""State of Grace"" (1990). Only four years later, Wright lit up the screen in what could have been an unforgiving role as Tom Hanks' one true love, Jenny, in the cultural phenomenon ""Forrest Gump"" (1994). After working under the direction of Penn for the first time in the harrowing drama ""The Crossing Guard"" (1995), she married the actor-director in 1996, thus beginning one of the more tumultuous on-and-off relationships in Hollywood. Wright appeared in a steady stream of mainstream and independent films, both with and without her talented husband, including ""She's So Lovely"" (1997), ""Message in a Bottle"" (1999), ""The Pledge"" (2001), ""A Home at the End of the World"" (2004) and ""Breaking and Entering"" (2006). After divorcing Penn in 2010, she reinvigorated her career with significant work in films like ""Moneyball"" (2011), ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (2011), ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) and ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), as well as drama series ""House of Cards"" (Netflix, 2013- ). Undeniably authentic in any role she tackled, Wright remained one of the more respected actresses working in film."
Danny Huston,"The third generation of a Hollywood empire that included father John Huston, sister Anjelica Huston and grandfather Walter Huston, Danny Huston began his career behind the camera but truly came into his own when he instead positioned himself in front of it. The dashing character actor with the rich voice and raffish charm earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for sending up the family business in ""ivans xtc"" (2000), and from that leading role, went on to give outstanding supporting performances in highly acclaimed dramas like ""21 Grams"" (2003),""The Aviator"" (2004), ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005) and ""Children of Men"" (2006). Throughout his career, the actor regularly showed an interest in heady, literary-inspired works, but he found his widest audience with a run of edge-of-your-seat blockbusters like ""30 Days of Night"" (2007), ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009) and ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), while portraying historical figures like King Richard the Lionheart in ""Robin Hood"" (2010) and the ancient Greek god of the ocean Poseidon in ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010) and ""Wrath of the Titans"" (2012). Whether on big screens or small, Huston proved that he possessed his father's adventurous spirit and was proudly using it to explore beyond the expected confines of the family name."
David Thewlis,"Actor David Thewlis pursued his creative passions all his life. As a true artist, Thewlis delved deeply into forms of expression other than the one that has earned him a living. Born in Blackpool, England, Thewlis spent a happy childhood filling diaries with ""words and sentences and poems"" - his first foray into an artistic life. Thewlis then explored music by playing in a punk band called Door 66. When the time came to decide his future, Thewlis chose to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and graduated in 1985. It was while in school that Thewlis turned to acting. A slave to twin passions of music and acting, Thewlis performed Simon & Garfunkel songs in clubs in order to earn his equity card. Meanwhile, Thewlis began appearing in commercials and on stage and snared a few small roles in film and on British television, including the movie-of-the-week ""The Singing Detective"" (PBS, 1988), ""Skulduggery"" (1989) and ""Life Is Sweet"" (1990), directed by Mike Leigh. Though his role ""Life Is Sweet"" was small, Thewlis impressed Leigh enough to be cast for the lead role in ""Naked"" (1993). His performance as Johnny, a down-and-out, yet intelligent drifter in Manchester whose brutal treatment of women defies convention as he lives outside the social norm of late-20th century England, earned Thewlis several awards for best actor, including that of the New York Critics, National Society of Film Critics, and the London Film Critics Circle. Thewlis went on to amass a resume of divergent roles, ranging from kid's movies to dark independents to big budget Hollywood productions. His next role after ""Naked"" was opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Total Eclipse"" (1995), an indie drama about the turbulent relationship between French poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. His next role became very special to the actor: as the voice of Earthworm in ""James and the Giant Peach"" (1996), Thewlis was subsequently asked on birthdays and other occasions to reprise his role for the children of friends and relatives. Next for Thewlis came ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (1996), John Frankenheimer's attempt to put H.G. Wells' novel on screen. Thewlis next starred in ""Dragonheart"" (1996), playing Einon, a medieval king whose despotic reign belies the near-death promise he made when he was a boy. In April 1996, Thewlis directed a short film he wrote called ""Hello Hello Hello?"" (1998) and later received an honorable BAFTA Award nomination for his effort. Thewlis meanwhile continued acting, starring opposite Brad Pitt in ""Seven Years in Tibet"" (1997), or as the crew liked to call it, ""Five Years on This Set"". His performance didn't earn Thewlis any award nominations, but he was banned from ever visiting China. After a small role in the Coen Brothers' ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), Thewlis starred opposite Thandie Newton in ""Besieged"" (1999), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. In ""Gangster No. 1"", Thewlis plays an old associate of Gangster 55 (Malcolm McDowell) who gets released from prison after a 30-year stint. And in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004), Thewlis played Professor Remis Lupin in the third adaptation of the popular novels. To top off a busy period, Thewlis directed his first feature-length film, ""Cheeky"" (2003), a comedy that was shown at the London Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival. Thewlis returned in front of the camera for ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005), playing a monk watching over the son (Orlando Bloom) of a knight (Liam Neeson) in this epic historical drama taking place in the relative calm between the 2nd and 3rd Crusades of the 12th century. He then had a supporting role in Terrence Malick's ""The New World"" (2005). Thewlis then signed on to appear in the sequel ""Basic Instinct 2"" (2006), starring Sharon Stone as the vampy novelist Catherine Tramell, who once again lures an unsuspecting man (David Morrissey) into a murderous trap. After a key role in the 2006 remake of horror classic ""The Omen,"" Thewlis starred as the title character in Paul Auster's little-seen drama ""The Inner Life of Martin Frost"" (2007) and reprised his role as the heroic Lupin in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007). In 2008, he had a supporting part in the Holocaust drama ""The Boy with the Striped Pajamas"" and subsequently returned to the Potter fold for ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009), as well as the concluding chapters of the fantasy saga ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" (2010) and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" (2011). With the Potter films continuing to bring in a sizeable paycheck, Thewlis was able to comfortably pursue smaller projects, including the drug-trade biopic ""Mr. Nice"" (2010), with Rhys Ifans, and ""London Boulevard"" (2010), a crime thriller starring Colin Farrell. Appearing in ""Anonymous"" (2011), another drama featuring Ifans, Thewlis stuck to other period pieces, portraying the husband of a dedicated Burmese politician in Luc Besson's ""The Lady"" (2011) and an unpleasant landlord in Steven Spielberg's World War I-era film ""War Horse"" (2011). Following a little time away from the spotlight, Thewlis revisited blockbuster fare, playing the enigmatic character of The Frog in the action sequel ""Red 2"" (2013). Supporting roles in Bill Condon's political thriller ""The Fifth Estate"" (2013), Terry Gilliam's ""The Zero Theorem"" (2013) and Stephen Hawking biopic ""The Theory of Everything"" (2014) followed in quick succession, followed by John Boorman's historical romantic drama ""Queen and Country"" (2014), psychological thriller ""Regression"" (2015) and the Tom Hardy-starring film about the notorious London gangsters the Kray twins, ""Legend"" (2015). After co-starring in Michael Fassbender's ""Macbeth"" (2015) as King Duncan, Thewlis appeared in comic book blockbuster ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) as Ares, the title character's adversary. That same year, Thewlis joined the cast of anthology series ""Fargo"" (FX 2015- ) for its third season."
Bradley Cooper,"Handsome and irreverently funny, Bradley Cooper's combination of romantic leading man and hilarious character actor chops helped him progress from TV guest spots to memorable parts in features in a relatively short amount of time. After attracting attention for his likable role as Jennifer Garner's reporter friend on ""Alias"" (ABC, 2001-06), Cooper fearlessly made his first major big screen impression as the unlikable groom in ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005). He regained audience's affection in lesser fare like ""Failure to Launch"" (2006) and, in testament to his charisma, emerged unscathed from Sandra Bullock's notorious bomb ""All About Steve"" (2008). Cooper ensured his own launch with the lead in the critical and box office juggernaut ""The Hangover"" (2009) and proved an invaluable member of the romantic, dramatic ensemble ""He's Just Not That Into You"" (2009) and ""Valentine's Day"" (2010) casts. Graduating to full-fledged stardom with a flashy role in ""The A-Team"" (2010), Cooper continued to rise as a bankable, talented and very much in-demand movie star, which was confirmed with a return to box-office prominence with ""The Hangover Part II"" (2011) and his star turn in David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012) opposite Jennifer Lawrence. That trio reunited twice more for ""American Hustle"" (2013) and ""Joy"" (2015), while Cooper continued starring in films ranging from Clint Eastwood's drama ""American Sniper"" (2014) to James Gunn's blockbuster action-comedy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) and its 2017 sequel, in which he provided the voice of Rocket, a raccoon-like mutant with serious anger management issues. Whether starring in comedies, thrillers or romantic dramas - as well as making a tabloid splash in the wake of rumored romances with some of Hollywood's loveliest leading ladies - Cooper propelled himself into becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars."
Lady Gaga,"Born in New York City in 1986, Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was better known by the stage name Lady Gaga. She began receiving piano lessons at the age of four, and by her teens, Gaga was writing her own songs and performing at open-mic nights around the city. Though she would enroll at the Tisch School of the Arts program Collaborative Arts Project 21, Gaga dropped out during her sophomore year to pursue a professional career, eventually coming up with her moniker inspired by the Queen song ""Radio Gaga,"" and working with performance artist Lady Starlight to develop her avant garde stage persona. Gaga signed a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV in 2007, writing songs for artists such as Fergie, the Pussycat Dolls, and Britney Spears, and she signed a recording contract with Interscope the same year. Her debut album, The Fame, was released in 2008 to major success, with an eight song EP, Fame Monster soon to follow. The two releases included such massive hit singles as ""Poker Face,"" ""Just Dance,"" and ""Bad Romance."" Her second studio album, Born This Way, came in 2011 and was another commercial and critical hit, however her third record, 2013's Artpop, proved a comparative disappointment. Gaga quickly bounced back the following year however, impressing audiences with a sophisticated collaborative jazz album with vocal legend Tony Bennett titled Cheek to Cheek. In 2015, Gaga fulfilled a lifelong desire to pursue a concurrent career as an actor, starring on the fifth season of the anthology series ""American Horror Story"" (FX, 2011-). She would return for a recurring role on the following season, even as she released her next album, Joanne, to major acclaim. She sang one song from the album, ""Million Reasons,"" during her landmark performance at the 2017 Super Bowl halftime show, which also included hits such as ""Poker Face"" and ""Born This Way."" The next year, Gaga found a project that combined her passions for both music and acting, starring as a burgeoning pop vocalist alongside writer and director Bradley Cooper in the fourth remake of the classic film ""A Star is Born"" (2018).  The film was a popular and critical success, earning  Gaga a Best Actress Oscar nomination and a win for Best Original Song for the film's centerpiece ballad ""Shallow."""
Sam Elliott,"Possessing rugged good looks and a rich, deep voice, Sam Elliott went from playing the quintessential cowboy to portraying thoughtful, sage characters throughout his long career. Born in Sacramento, California, he spent most of his youth in Portland, Oregon. After dropping out of college, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Roles in television shows such as ""The Felony Squad"" (ABC, 1966-69) and ""The F.B.I."" (ABC, 1965-74), as well as a bit part in the Paul Newman-Robert Redford vehicle ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969), soon followed. He landed a recurring role on the hit ""Mission: Impossible"" (CBS, 1966-73) that kicked off a long period of steady work. Elliott made regular guest appearances on many of the police dramas of the '70s, including ""Hawaii Five-O"" (CBS, 1968-80) and ""The Streets of San Francisco"" (ABC, 1972-77). He experienced his first true breakthrough with the film ""Lifeguard"" (1976), playing a beach bum who reevaluates his life after attending his high school reunion. The actor also took advantage of the television miniseries craze, starring in ""Once an Eagle"" (NBC, 1976) and ""Aspen"" (NBC, 1977). His looks, including his trademark thick mustache, made him a natural for cowboy roles. He teamed with Tom Selleck for a pair of TV films based on Louis L' Amour books, ""The Sacketts"" (NBC, 1978) and ""The Shadow Riders"" (CBS, 1982), which became some of his most memorable roles in the genre. Not one to be boxed in, he diversified his resume by playing Farrah Fawcett's abusive husband in ""Murder in Texas"" (NBC, 1981) and Cher's love interest in ""Mask"" (1985). He added another archetype to his repertoire - the elder, male mentor - when he joined Patrick Swayze for the surprise hit ""Road House"" (1989). He continued mixing roles in Westerns like ""Tombstone"" (1993) and ""Buffalo Girls"" (CBS, 1995), with more traditional dramas such as ""Rush"" (1991). The Coen brothers found a perfect use for Elliott's voice and persona when they cast him as The Stranger, the narrator of their classic Jeff Bridges comedy ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998). The actor branched out into other genres as well with roles in the superhero films ""Hulk"" (2003) and ""Ghost Rider"" (2007), in addition to the fantasy epic ""The Golden Compass"" (2007). He continued making appearances on television, taking memorable roles on ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-15), ""Grace and Frankie"" (Netflix, 2015-), and ""Justified"" (FX, 2010-15), the latter of which earned him a Critics' Choice Award. He stepped into a series regular role when he joined Ashton Kutcher and Debra Winger for ""The Ranch"" (Netflix, 2016-) playing the irascible patriarch of the show's ranching family, Beau Bennett. Bradley Cooper tabbed Elliott, along with Lady Gaga, for his directing debut ""A Star Is Born"" (2018). The actor played the older brother of Cooper's spiraling singing star. The role earned Elliott his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor."
Andrew Dice Clay,"Andrew Dice Clay was an American actor and comedian who rose to superstardom in the late 1980s by performing at sold out arenas all across the country as his foul-mouthed comedy alter ego, ""The Diceman."" Clay, who was born Andrew Clay Silverstein, grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. As a young boy, Clay loved to entertain. He would impress both family and friends with his spot-on impressions of famous people, and by the age of 7 began playing the drums. He eventually became such a skilled drummer that by his early teens, Clay was performing regularly at bar mitzvahs and weddings in the Catskills club circuit. When he turned 20, however, Clay decided to take a crack at a career in standup comedy. He began performing impressions at clubs in his hometown neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and would leave audiences cracking up with his hilarious performances. One character in particular that Clay developed during this period was ""The Diceman,"" a foul-mouthed leather jacket wearing tough guy, who was kind of a wisecracking version of John Travolta's character in ""Grease"" (1978). In 1980 Clay relocated to Los Angeles, where there were far more opportunities for an upstart comic. He started performing his Diceman character on stage at the world famous Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip. His act caught the attention of Hollywood producers and casting agents, who subsequently cast Clay in film and TV parts. He made his film debut in the 1982 comedy ""Wacko,"" and in the ensuing years nabbed a small recurring role on ""Diff'rent Strokes"" (NBC, 1978-1986), a small role in John Hughes' ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986), and a recurring role on the NBC crime series ""Crime Story"" (NBC, 1986-88). Throughout the 1980s Clay performed his Diceman character in clubs all across the country, while developing a devoted following of fans. Then, in 1989, he released his first comedy album Dice (1989), which prominently featured the character, which made him an overnight sensation. Clay was featured on TV shows and in magazines, making him one of the most recognized comedians in the country. In 1990 he became the first comedian in history to sell out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row. 1990 was also the year Clay starred in the action-comedy film ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" (1990). Clay's popularity as a standup hit a high point in the early 1990s, but by 1995 he had grown tired of The Diceman character. As a result, he decided to change his comedy act, so that he was talking about more personal issues, like his life as a father and husband. It was also around this period that Clay began focusing more on his film and TV acting. In 1995 he nabbed a starring role on the sitcom ""Bless This House"" (CBS, 1995-96). That series, however, was cancelled after a single season. Over the next 15 years Clay went on to appear in films like ""Whatever It Takes"" (1998) and ""Foolish"" (1999), as well as the reality series ""The Celebrity Apprentice 2"" (NBC, 2009), in which he was the first contestant to be fired by future U.S. President Donald J. Trump. Dice did not have any credited film or TV roles form 2002 to 2010, but in 2011 he slowly began making a comeback as a serious film and TV actor. In 2011, he played a down-on-his-luck version of himself on the final season of the HBO comedy-drama ""Entourage"" (HBO, 2004-2011), and two years later would go on to earn the best reviews of his career for his supporting role in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" (2013). In 2016 Clay played himself on the Showtime comedy series ""Dice"" (Showtime, 2016-17), but the series was cancelled after two seasons. Then, in 2018, Clay again received rave reviews for his role as the father of Lady Gaga's character in the Oscar-winning musical film ""A Star Is Born."" 2018 was also the year that Clay launched his very first podcast, ""I'm Ova Hea' Now."""
Rafi Gavron,"Born in London to a Jewish family with Israeli roots, actor Rafi Gavron has enjoyed a successful career on this side of the pond. He landed his first film role as a parkour-loving thief in the 2006 drama ""Breaking and Entering,"" and has since portrayed the flamboyant singer of a mostly-gay punk band in the NYC-set ""Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist,"" and landed a minor role in the romantic drama ""Celeste & Jesse Forever."" In 2009, Gavron landed a recurring role on the primetime TV hit ""24,"" and later played a high school teen on the family series ""Life Unexpected."""
Anthony Ramos,"Audiences instantly became familiar with actor Anthony Ramos when he joined the original cast of the massively popular musical ""Hamilton."" Though the surge in popularity that the show brought about was epic, Ramos had already been working hard and paying his dues in the world of musical theater when he won the part. Born in Brooklyn in 1991, Ramos' first love was baseball. Though he enjoyed singing in school ensembles, he had the highest batting average on his high school's baseball team, and planned to pursue the sport further until he landed a role in a school musical and discovered his new passion. Ramos participated in some community theater before earning a scholarship to attend the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. After graduating in 2011, he appeared in several plays, including a New Jersey production of ""Grease"" and a nationally touring production of ""Damn Yankees."" He eventually won a role in Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""In the Heights,"" which began a working relationship between the two. Ramos created the role of Laboy for himself in Miranda's 2014 short musical ""21 Chump Street,"" and in 2015, was cast in the roles of John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in ""Hamilton."" The following year, Ramos made his feature film debut in the drama ""White Girl"" (2016)."
Amy Poehler,"One of the best-known comedians to emerge from the improvisational comedy scene of the 1990s, Amy Poehler performed tirelessly on Chicago and New York stages before making her mainstream breakout as a cast member of ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ). She had previously starred in ""The Upright Citizens Brigade"" (Comedy Central, 1998-2000), a sketch comedy show created by the improv group of the same name, which morphed into a hotbed of emerging talent. During her seven-year run on ""SNL,"" Poehler skewered celebs like Kelly Ripa, Avril Lavigne and Sharon Osbourne; served as co-anchor of Weekend Update; and delivered a memorable impression of then-Senator and presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. Poehler transitioned successfully to the big screen with a pair of Tina Fey-scripted features, ""Mean Girls"" (2004), and ""Baby Mama"" (2008). Maintaining a foothold in television, Poehler was the creator of the charming animated series ""The Mighty B!"" (Nickelodeon, 2008-2011) and the star of the small town sitcom ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-2015), while her additional in-demand status as a voiceover actor in films like Pixar's ""Inside Out"" (2015) made her one of the most successful cross-media comics of her generation."
Phyllis Smith,"Originally a dancer by trade, actress Phyllis Smith segued into acting success purely by chance. Her dancing career, which included stints as a professional football cheerleader and a burlesque performer, ended suddenly with a knee injury, prompting a foray into the world of television casting that ultimately led to a regular job on the other side of the camera. Smith later came to prominence with NBC's smash comedy ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-2013) after the bespectacled and bouffant brunette charmed producers. With her hilarious deadpan double-takes, she eventually wooed primetime audiences as the unassuming, chipper paper saleswoman Phyllis Lapin, one of the hapless drone office workers at the Scranton, Pennsylvania-based paper company, Dunder-Mifflin."
Richard Kind,"A television character actor and busy voiceover artist, Richard Kind came up through the 1980s improv comedy scene before becoming one of the more prolific supporting players on primetime. He was best recognized for his concurrent roles on the long-running sitcoms ""Mad About You"" (NBC, 1992-99) and ""Spin City"" (ABC, 1996-2002), but throughout his career, he held down a busy schedule in New York musical theater and as an occasional film player. Kind was often cast as bookish, whiny, nebbish types, including in his film career high-water mark in the Coen Brothers' ""A Serious Man"" (2009), but Kind's voice characterizations in Disney/Pixar animated hits like ""A Bug's Life"" (1998) and ""Cars"" (2006) truly afforded the actor the opportunity to stretch his legs and exercise his talent for unpredictable stage comedy."
Bill Hader,
Lewis Black,"With arms flailing, fingers jabbing every-which-way, and a gravely voice ranting about hypocritical politicians or ridiculous social mores, comedian Lewis Black made a living spewing disdain and vitriol, both as a stand-up comic and as a weekly commentator on the popular mock news program, ""The Daily Show"" (Comedy Central, 1996- ). Black turned the role of the angry curmudgeon railing against the injustices of our times into a cottage industry, becoming a favorite among an increasingly skeptical and cynical audience that has ranged in age from teenagers to the elderly. Prior to ""The Daily Show,"" Black toiled in stand-up comedy, performing at clubs and venues across the United States, while trying desperately to become a successful playwright. But it was his grumbling grouse character developed over the years in front of a microphone, that finally launched Black into celebrity, a slow process that brought the comedian eventual triumph at twice the age of other comedians around him. Although Black left ""The Daily Show"" in early 2016, he continued his stand-up and writing careers, as well as taking on high profile voice gigs such as playing the emotion Anger in Pixar's ""Inside Out"" (2015)."
Mindy Kaling,
Awkwafina,"Awkwafina, the stage name of Nora Lum, grew up with more classic influences. The first-generation Chinese-American studied classical and jazz music as a teenager. During this time, though, she began to start creating rap music as Awkwafina. It remained in the background, though, as she studied Mandarin for two years in China and then finished her college career at SUNY Albany studying journalism. Even after she graduated in 2011, her rap career was firmly in the background as she went down a career path consisting of editorial and public relations jobs. She broke through in 2013, though, as Awkwafina became a more known commodity on YouTube. In early 2014, she released her first album Yellow Ranger. Later that year, she started acting, joining the cast of comedy series ""Girl Code"" (MTV 2013-15) in its third season. That helped open doors to more acting roles, and she appeared in Seth Rogen-starring comedy ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" (2016) and the indie film ""Dude"" (2016). She rounded out in 2016 with voice-over roles in ""Storks"" (2016) and ""Regular Show"" (Cartoon Network 2010-2017) before being cast in the female-starring ""Ocean's Eleven"" spin-off ""Ocean's Eight"" (2018), alongside Sandra Bullock, Rihanna, and Anne Hathaway."
Tzi Ma,"The Hong Kong-born Tzi Ma, who studied theatre and dance in America, has proven that Asian men can carve out a successful niche in Hollywood, even if they aren't action superstars like Jackie Chan or Jet Li. One of his earliest roles to gain notice was as the main heavy in 1992's ""Rapid Fire,"" in which he fought hand-to-hand on an elevated train platform with Brandon Lee, son of the legendary Bruce Lee. But for most of the decade, it was just as common to see Ma in roles that didn't require kung-fu kicks; he was effective in the 1994 drama ""Golden Gate"" (written by David Henry Hwang, with whom he collaborated numerous times for the stage) and on ""NYPD Blue"" in the recurring part of Detective Harold Ng. In 2002, he played a shadowy assistant to Michael Caine's British journalist in ""The Quiet American,"" one of the more critically acclaimed films of the year. This gave his career a boost, and he subsequently landed his highest-profile film yet: the Coen Brothers' 2004 remake of ""The Ladykillers,"" which allowed Ma to show off a more comedic side. During this time, he was also active in independent film, playing a retiree desperately trying to hide a dark secret from his three grown daughters in ""Red Doors."" As for television work, Ma appeared in the series ""24"" as Cheng Zhi, a Chinese official who matches wits and wills, as opposed to fists, with protagonist Jack Bauer."

John Krasinski,"As the bright, but beleaguered Jim Halpert on NBC's hit comedy ""The Office"" (2005-2013), actor John Krasinski struck the fancy of both viewers and critics alike with his boyish antics and one-of-a-kind facial expressions, usually directed straight at the camera. As one of the few sane employees in the workplace asylum known as Dunder-Mifflin, Krasinski's Halpert was often forced to deal with such day-to-day challenges as the boredom of his hum-drum existence, the demands of an annoyingly needy boss (Steve Carell) and lastly, a crush on co-worker Pam (Jenna Fisher) that captured the public's attention until the characters actually dated and later married. Prior to his ""Office"" stardom, Krasinski had a handful of minor feature roles while logging episodes of popular shows like ""Without a Trace"" (CBS, 2002-09) and ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" (NBC, 2001-2011). Because of his success, he landed roles in the features ""Leatherheads"" (2008), ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" (2009) and ""Something Borrowed"" (2011), which increased his profile. As he branched out into writing and directing with ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"" (2009), ""The Promised Land"" (2012) and ""The Hollars"" (2015), Krasinski allowed himself the opportunity to bring his Everyman charm to a much wider audience."

Kaitlyn Dever,"Born and raised in the American Southwest, Kaitlyn Dever spent her youth bouncing between gymnastics and ballet before eventually most enjoying acting. She broke in at the age of 13, first appearing in ""An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong"" (2009) and an episode of ""Modern Family"" (ABC 2009-2019). In 2011, Dever landed two major television roles, first as Tim Allen's daughter on the sitcom ""Last Man Standing"" (ABC/Fox 2011- ) and the recurring role of Loretta McCready on ""Justified"" (FX 2010-15). She also worked with a variety of notable film directors around the same time, including Martin Scorsese on ""J. Edgar"" (2011), James Ponsoldt on ""The Spectacular Now"" (2013), Jason Reitman on ""Men, Women & Children"" (2014). Additionally, her supporting roles in the Brie Larson-starring ""Short Term 12"" (2013) and black comedy ""Bad Teacher"" (2012) drew much acclaim. She starred in her first major feature films in 2019, ranging from the teen comedy ""Booksmart"" (2019), in which she starred opposite Beanie Feldstein, to the Olivia Colman-starring thriller ""Them That Follow"" (2019). Dever also appeared in the Toni Collette-starring miniseries ""Unbelievable"" (Netflix 2019)."
Beanie Feldstein,"Famous not just for her acting and singing chops but also for her famous brother, actor Jonah Hill, Beanie Feldstein was born in Los Angeles, California in 1993. Though she dealt with and eventually recovered from a childhood case of vocal nodules, Feldstein began acting in children's theatre productions at age five, and developed a tremendous love of musicals, even going so far as to have a ""Funny Girl"" (1968)-themed birthday party. She booked her first major acting role at age nine, appearing on an episode of the Damon Wayans sitcom ""My Wife and Kids"" (ABC, 2001-05) in 2002. Feldstein subsequently attended Wesleyan College, where she appeared in numerous student productions while earning her degree in sociology. While attending school, Feldstein continued to make television appearances, acting in the first episode of the HBO mini-series ""The Devil You Know"" (HBO, 2015) and on an episode of the acclaimed series ""Orange is the New Black"" (Netflix, 2013-). In 2016, just six weeks after graduating from college, Feldstein booked her first feature film, playing a boisterous sorority girl in the comedy ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" (2016). After filming Whitney Cummings' ensemble comedy ""The Female Brain"" (2017), Feldbrain scored critical acclaim as Julie, the best friend of Saoirse Ronan's title character in Greta Gerwig's comedy-drama ""Lady Bird"" (2017). While that film was in theaters, Feldstein was making her Broadway debut, playing Minnie Fay opposite Bette Midler in a revival of ""Hello, Dolly!"" Her next film, the teen comedy ""Booksmart"" (2019), provided Feldstein with her first starring role opposite Caitlyn Dever as a pair of bookish high school students wanting to experience the fun si e of school before graduation. The film, directed by actress Olivia Wilde  was a critical and commercial success."
Jessica Williams,
Jason Sudeikis,"Jason Sudeikis delivered his sketches with a dry wit and a smugness that often left viewers feeling there was more to the joke than he was letting on, yet he radiated an endearing Everyman quality while playing even the most obnoxious of characters. The talented performer made the rounds in Chicago's club circuit before landing a coveted spot on the iconic sketch comedy series, ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ); first as a writer and then a cast member. Sudeikis quickly gained a huge fan base with his memorable portrayals of an ESPN sportscaster promoting feminine hygiene products, or of an annoying preppy with zero social skills. One of his biggest fans was the equally talented ""SNL"" alum, Tina Fey, who cast Sudeikis as her one-true-love interest on her hit series, ""30 Rock"" (NBC, 2006-13). As he savored his small screen success, he also began racking up supporting roles in feature films like ""What Happens in Vegas"" (2008), ""Semi-Pro"" (2008), and ""Going the Distance"" (2010). A starring role in the dark comedy ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011) pitted Sudeikis against more seasoned actors like Jamie Foxx, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston, and established him not only as an A-list comedian but positioned him to become a bankable movie star. Starring roles in broad comedies like ""We're the Millers"" (2013) and ""Masterminds"" (2016) followed, but Sudeikis also maintained a presence in TV, appearing in Will Forte's absurdist ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Fox 2015- ) and starring in the partially-animated sitcom ""Son of Zorn"" (Fox 2016- )."
Lisa Kudrow,"Though she made her name portraying slightly ditsy, even flaky characters on the small screen, actress Lisa Kudrow also proved to be an adept performer in both independent and studio films. After several years as a guest star on several popular shows, Kudrow skyrocketed to superstardom alongside her five cast mates on the immensely successful sitcom ""Friends"" (NBC, 1994-2004). For ten seasons, fans of the show delighted in Kudrow's deft portrayal of the naïve, but strangely wise Phoebe Buffay, a masseuse and struggling folk singer who seemingly once lived an impossibly storied life, complete with being homeless throughout her entire adolescence. But unlike her five co-stars, Kudrow actively sought to subvert the image she created onscreen by tackling a diverse range of characters in features, including an excellent performance as a sexually repressed spinster in ""The Opposite of Sex"" (1998), though she sometimes catered to that ditzy image, as she did in the popular comedy, ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"" (1997). Nonetheless, Kudrow managed to break away from her Phoebe persona following the show's exit in 2004, though the critically-acclaimed series ""The Comeback"" (HBO, 2005) was more of a cult phenomenon than her previous mainstream success. However, Kudrow began to thrive on the margins: while appearing in popular films like ""Easy A"" (2010) ""Neighors"" (2014) and its sequel ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" (2016) and the thriller ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016), Kudrow created and starred in improvised comedy webseries, ""Web Therapy"" (2008-14). A modified TV version ran on Showtime from 2011 to 2015, giving the star new popularity and once again confirming the diversity of her talent."
Will Forte,"Comedian Will Forte carved a successful Hollywood career out of playing characters that bordered on the absurd. The actor made his television debut as a cast member of the iconic late night variety show, ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ) where he made viewers laugh week after week with spot-on celebrity impersonations and original, off-kilter characters. One of Forte's most memorable ""SNL"" roles was a hapless, mullet-sporting special ops agent named MacGruber.  The sketches, which lampooned the hit action series ""MacGyver"" (ABC, 1985-1992), often found the bumbling title character locked in a control room while attempting to diffuse a ticking time bomb. In 2010, Forte delivered more laughs with a feature film version of ""MacGruber,"" an explosive comedy that proved he was one of the most committed and funniest actors to come out of ""SNL."""
Anthony Gonzalez,
Benjamin Bratt,"A versatile veteran of both film and television, actor Benjamin Bratt came to prominence during the 1990s with his Emmy-nominated work on the perennial procedural, ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010), where he spent four seasons as homicide detective Reynaldo Curtis. Prior to that role, Bratt had a number of supporting parts in movies like ""Demolition Man"" (1993), ""Clear and Present Danger"" (1994) and ""The River Wild"" (1994). In addition to his television fame, Bratt found himself a tabloid fixture when he began dating ""America's Sweetheart"" Julia Roberts, before the couple parted ways just shy of four years and after her 2001 Oscar win, bringing the private actor much dreaded headlines. After leaving ""Law & Order"" in 1999, he had co-starring roles in a number of divergent films, playing the head of a Mexican drug cartel in ""Traffic"" (2000), the partner of a bumbling FBI agent in ""Miss Congeniality"" (2000), a streetwise poet in ""Piñero"" (2001) and a loyal brother-in-law in ""The Woodsman"" (2004). He made a return to television as the star of the short-lived military drama ""E-Ring"" (2005-06), before returning to features for ""The Great Raid"" (2005) and ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" (2007). Bratt established himself as an actor of significant depth as the lead of the gritty serialized addiction drama, ""The Cleaner"" (A&E, 2008-09), and moved on to primetime soaps with a recurring-turned-regular role on the popular medical drama, ""Private Practice"" (ABC, 2007-13). Whether as the lead or in a supporting role, Bratt maintained a broad range of appeal in a wide array of performances."
Alanna Ubach,"Alanna Ubach started her acting career at a young age. When she was still in her teens, Ubach appeared in her first TV show, the Disney sitcom ""The Torkelsons."" She is best remembered by children of the 1990s, however, for her role as mad-but-informative scientist Beakman's first assistant on the educational television show ""Beakman's World."" Ubach next branched out into more and varied television roles, including small parts on primetime dramas like ""L.A. Law"" and ""ER."" She also began to do more movie work in the 1990s, appearing in the comedies ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" and ""The Brady Bunch Movie."" Ubach's visibility increased further in the early 2000s with continued television appearances, including stints on the Aaron Sorkin projects ""Sports Night"" and ""The West Wing."" Her movie roles ultimately gave her even more attention, with memorable turns in ""Legally Blonde II"" (as sorority girl Serena) and ""Meet the Fockers"" (as Ben Stiller's ex-babysitter, for which she wore a fat-suit). In the latter part of the 2000s Ubach also branched out into voice acting, lending her talents to animated shows like ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"" and ""El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera."""
Jaime Camil,"Born in Mexico City in 1973, Jaime Camil's professional career in entertainment began as a radio commentator, which segued into his first work in front of the camera, as a TV host on the Mexican show ""Qué nochecita con Jaime Camil"" (TV Azteca (Mexico), 1996). He gained international exposure playing the role of Don Fernando Mendiola on ""La Fea Más Bella"" (Canal de las Estrellas (Mexico), 2006-2007), the (second) Mexican version of the Colombian telenovela ""Yo soy Betty la Fea"" (RCN (Colombia), 1999-2001) which also spawned the US version ""Ugly Betty"" (ABC, 2006-2010). Camil was also known for his talent as a voice actor, dubbing Ashton Kutcher's voice in the film ""Open Season"" (2006), Jerry Seinfeld's in the film ""Bee Movie"" (2007). Camil is also known for playing multiple roles as he did in ""Los Exitosos Pérez"" (Televisa (Mexico), 2009-2014) in which he played twins and ""Por Ella Soy Eva"" (Canal de las Estrellas (Mexico), 2012-2013) in which he played a character who disguised himself as an opinionated older woman a la ""Tootsie"" (1982) or ""Mrs Doubtfire"" (1993). His largest exposure to American audiences came in his appearances on the TV show ""Jane the Virgin"" (The CW, 2014-). On the show he plays the biological father of the title character. The show was nominated for Best Television Series - Comedy or Musical at the 2015 Golden Globe Awards."
Alfonso Arau,"Better recognized as an actor by American moviegoers for essaying funny, vaguely menacing, sometimes self-aware Latino stereotypes, Alfonso Arau crafted an even more auspicious body of work as one of Mexico's most laurel-laden film directors. Starting as a film actor in the 1950s and breaking into television in revolutionary Cuba in the early 1960s, Arau re-immersed himself in the cinema of his native land in the 1970s, collaborating with Mexican film greats Alberto Isaac and Alejandro Jodorowsky and taking up the auteur mantle himself with the comedy ""El águila descalza"" (1971). He drew greater acclaim for the 1974 subversive comedy ""Inspector Calzonzin."" The 1980s saw him don some memorable comedic supporting roles in U.S. films, notably an amiable jefe of a drug gang in ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984) and a hyperbolic desperado in ""Three Amigos!"" (1986). He established himself in the upper echelon of directors with the multiple-award-winning ""Like Water for Chocolate"" (1992), based on the novel by his wife Laura Esquivel. The success garnered him work in the U.S. helming the period romance ""A Walk in the Clouds"" (1995), the oddball ensemble comedy ""Picking Up the Pieces"" (2000) and the ambitious TV miniseries remake of the ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (A&E, 2002). Back in his native country, Arau would helm the surreal, would-be epic ""Zapata"" (2004) to a storm of controversy. Building a legacy of iconoclastic and mystically-tinged movies, Arau would be credited as a prime catalyst in the re-establishment of a distinctive identity for Mexican film."
Chris Hemsworth,"Tall, muscular and exceptionally handsome, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth became a star in the U.S. with a series of well-received genre films. He was a household name in his native country while starring on the popular drama series, ""Home and Away"" (7 Network, 1988- ), playing an opinionated student navigating his way through high school in a seaside town. He quickly became a sci-fi sensation across the pond with a brief but memorable role in the J.J. Abrams reboot of the worldwide phenomenon ""Star Trek"" (2009) as Capt. James T. Kirk's ill-fated father. But it was not until he landed the lead role in the film version of the comic book hero ""Thor"" (2011) - beating out his younger brother, fellow heartthrob Liam, in the process - that Hemsworth truly flexed his muscles, establishing himself as one of the most charismatic young actors of the moment. Lionsgate films quickly capitalized on Hemsworth's popularity by releasing the long-delayed horror feature ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012), co-written by Joss Whedon. Ironically, it was Whedon who later directed the young star in the superhero blockbuster ""The Avengers"" (2012), bringing together ""Thor"" and Marvel Studios' other franchise films. Along with his continuing screen presence as the Nordic superhero, Hemsworth expanded with range with films ranging from the thriller ""Blackhat"" (2015), Ron Howard's sailing drama ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (2015), and two fantasy films based on fairy tales, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016). As talented as he was attractive, Hemsworth was without a doubt, a leading man to watch."
Tom Hiddleston,"British actor Tom Hiddleston rose from an acclaimed stage career to international prominence with major supporting roles in a string of hit films in 2011, including ""Thor,"" Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" and Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse."" His extensive theatrical training proved essential for these larger-than-life roles, which ranged from a vengeful Norse god and a legendary novelist to a courageous but doomed World War I officer. Prior to his emergence on the international scene, Hiddleston was featured largely in supporting roles on U.K. television, but in the wake of ""Thor,"" he became an in-demand player on both sides of the Atlantic. The following year proved an even bigger jackpot, with a reprisal of his villainous ""Thor"" role in ""The Avengers"" (2012) and a starring turn as Prince Hal in PBS productions of ""Henry IV"" and ""Henry V."" More than anything else, it was his versatility and cheeky charm that minted Tom Hiddleston as certified scene stealer on the verge of worldwide stardom."
Cate Blanchett,"A gifted performer who developed her talent at a young age, actress Cate Blanchett grew into an exceptional actress who achieved international acclaim with her Oscar-nominated turn as a young Elizabeth I in ""Elizabeth"" (1998). Prior to that role, the alluring Australian found herself thrust into the spotlight with just her third feature, ""Oscar and Lucinda"" (1997). Post-""Elizabeth,"" Blanchett quickly blossomed into one of Hollywood's most esteemed actresses. Following a prominent turn as a wealthy socialite in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999), she was a Southern woman with psychic abilities in ""The Gift"" (2000), played Kevin Spacey's wife in ""The Shipping News"" (2001) and was the titular slain Irish journalist in ""Veronica Guerin"" (2003). Seemingly favoring smaller films, it came as a surprise that Blanchett appeared as the elf Galadriel in the blockbuster trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings"" (2001-03), which she followed with a critically hailed performance as Katharine Hepburn in ""The Aviator"" (2004). From there, Blanchett traveled easily from small indies to major studio films, earning acclaim for her work in ""Babel"" (2006), ""Notes on a Scandal"" (2006) and ""I'm Not There"" (2007), to vamping her way through ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). Following further critical praise for ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008), Blanchett delivered memorable turns in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" (2013), winning the Best Actress Oscar for her role, and Todd Haynes' 1950s period piece ""Carol"" (2015), based on Patricia Highsmith's lesbian-themed novel The Price of Salt. Blanchett's range and remarkable skill solidified her status as one of Hollywood's most preeminent performers."
Idris Elba,"Idris Elba was a British actor who became known for playing the Baltimore drug dealer Stringer Bell on HBO's widely-acclaimed drama ""The Wire"" (HBO, 2002-08), in addition to countless other high profile television and film roles. Elba was born in Hackney, London in 1972. His parents were immigrants (his father was born in Sierra Leone, while his mother was from Ghana), and moved to London by way of Sierra Leone shortly before Elba was born. Elba grew up in East Ham and Hackney, and first got interested in acting after seeing an advertisement in a London-based entertainment publication. The advertisement was asking newbie actors to audition for a new play. Elba jumped at the opportunity, and showed up at the audition. On his first try, Elba landed the part, and would later meet his first agent while performing in the play. Performing in the play was an eye-opening experience for Elba, who decided quickly after that he wanted to be an actor. At the age of 16 he was able to land a huge break by landing a spot in the National Youth Music Theater, thanks to a grant from the Prince's Trust charitable organization. While a member of the National Youth Music Theater, Elba was able to hone his acting craft, while developing the necessary skills he needed to make it as a performer. It was also around this time that Elba began working for his uncle's wedding D.J. company and found that he absolutely loved scratching records. His love grew so strong that by his late teens Elba embarked on a career as a D.J. He would go on to play music in London nightclubs in the evening, while working a number of odd jobs by the day. In his early 20s Elba made a serious attempt at launching his acting career. In addition to working his D.J. jobs, in which he went by the name of Big Driis, he began auditioning for film and TV roles. By the mid-1990s, Elba was landing steady acting work in the U.K. He nabbed guest spots on the children's sitcom ""2point4 Children"" (BBC One, 1991-99) and the British comedy series ""Absolutely Fabulous"" (BBC Two/BBC One, 1992-2012), before landing a recurring role on the crime series ""The Ruth Rendell Mysteries"" (ITV, 1987-2000). By the late 90s and early 2000s Elba was nabbing recurring parts on a number of British television shows, including ""Insiders"" (BBC One, 1997), ""Ultraviolet"" (Channel 4, 1998), and ""Dangerfield"" (BBC One, 1995-99). Then in 2002 Elba landed his first big break across the pond when he was cast as Stringer Bell, a Baltimore-based drug kingpin, on David Simon's multi-layered crime drama series ""The Wire."" Elba played Stringer Bell for 37 episodes of the widely-acclaimed series, before his character was killed off in season 3. After playing Stringer Bell for three years, Idris Elba's acting career in both the U.K. and the United States flourished. In addition to nabbing parts in high-profile films like ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007) and ""American Gangster"" (2007), he starred as the title character in the BBC crime series ""Luther"" (BBC One, 2010 - ). He also landed a recurring role on the beloved American sitcom ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-2013) in 2009. By the early 2010s Elba's acting profile continued to grow at a rapid pace. He appeared in blockbuster films like ""Thor"" (2011), ""Prometheus"" (2012), and ""Pacific Rim"" (2013), and was also cast as Nelson Mandela in the 2013 bio pic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" (2013). In 2016 Elba was nominated for a Golden Globe for his captivating performance in the drama ""Beasts of No Nation"" (2015), and appeared in the films ""Molly's Game"" (2017) and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018). 2019 also proved to be a big year for Idris Elba. In addition to co-creating and starring in the Netflix series ""Turn Up Charlie"" (Netflix, 2019- ), a partially autobiographical show that was based on his experiences as a D.J., Elba appeared alongside The Rock and Jason Statham in the blockbuster action film ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw"" (2019). When ""Hobbs and Shaw"" was released in the summer of 2019 the film made over $700 billion, making it one of the highest grossing films of the year-just another reason why Idris Elba had certified his status as one of Hollywood's most bankable actors of the 2010s."
Jeff Goldblum,"Despite having starred in some of the biggest blockbuster films of all time, actor Jeff Goldblum had often opted to portray offbeat characters in limited release indies. After breaking in as a drug-addled thug in ""Death Wish"" (1974), Goldblum spent several years looking for that one breakthrough role that would propel his career to the next level. That role came when he played a seedy magazine journalist who reconnects with his college friends during a funeral in ""The Big Chill"" (1983). But his biggest moment arrived with a star-making leading role in ""The Fly"" (1986), which earned him widespread critical plaudits. Though he spent the next several years in some rather forgettable features, Goldblum reached new heights as an unorthodox scientist in the hit action film ""Jurassic Park"" (1993). Three years later, he starred in one of the biggest box office draws of all time, ""Independence Day"" (1996), which solidified his status as one of Hollywood's top stars. While he maintained a prolific output of film and television over the next two decades, Goldblum took a step back to concentrate on lower-profile independents like ""Igby Goes Down"" (2002) - not at all unusual for the iconoclastic performer."
Tessa Thompson,"Tessa Thompson's confident screen presence helped to make her a major screen talent in the late 2010s, with starring roles in such critically and box office hits as ""Selma"" (2014), ""Creed"" (2015), ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) and ""Sorry to Bother You"" (2018). Born Tessa Lynn Thompson on October 3, 1983 in Los Angeles, California, she hailed from a musical family - her father was Marc Anthony Thompson, founder of the neo-soul collective Chocolate Genius, Inc., and her maternal grandfather was rumba bandleader and television host Bobby Ramos - and divided her childhood between Los Angeles and New York City. She began acting as a student at Santa Monica High School, and focused on a degree in cultural anthropology at Santa Monica College while continuing to perform on stages across Los Angeles. These included a 2005 performance in ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the Boston Court Theatre in Pasadena that earned an NAACP theater nomination. That same year, Thompson made her screen acting debut in an episode of the CBS crime drama ""Cold Case,"" which was soon followed by series regular work in the second season of ""Veronica Mars"" (UPN/CW, 2004-07) as Jackie Cook, a potential love interest for Percy Daggs III's crime-solving Wallace Fennell. From there, she worked steadily on television, including recurring roles on ""Heroes"" (NBC, 2006-2010, 2015) , ""Detroit 1-8-7"" (ABC, 2010-11) and the Tom Fontana/Barry Levinson period crime series ""Copper"" (BBC America, 2012-13); feature work during this period included a lead in Tina Mabry's powerful ""Mississippi Damned"" (2009), with Thompson as a rural Southern girl subjected to terrible abuse, the dance drama ""Make It Happen"" (2008) and Tyler Perry's adaptation of ""For Colored Girls"" (2010). She earned her big break as the star of Justin Simien's ""Dear White People"" (2014), playing a college radio host whose social observations roil the white, conservative students and faculty at a fictitious university. The critical praise afforded to her performance led to more substantive roles, including civil rights activist Diane Nash in Ava DuVernay's ""Selma"" (2014), as Michael B. Jordan's independent-minded love interest in ""Creed"" (2015), and as Delos Board member Charlotte Hale on HBO's ""Westworld"" (2016- ).The following year, Thompson was seen by millions in Marvel Studios' ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017), playing a flinty slave trader who imprisons and later befriends Chris Hemsworth's God of Thunder. A box office hit, ""Thor"" helped to mint Thompson as a star, and she parlayed her fame into starring roles in indie fare like the Western ""Little Woods"" (2018) and the critically acclaimed satire ""Sorry to Bother You"" (2018) and mainstream fare like the science fiction thriller ""Annihilation"" (2018) and ""Creed II"" (2018)."
Sally Hawkins,"International audiences were universally charmed by Sally Hawkins' performance as an indefatigably cheerful school teacher in Mike Leigh's comedy ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" (2008). For many moviegoers, this was their first exposure to her talents, but the British actress was a familiar face in films and on television and stage in her native country, where she had made strong impressions as fragile but determined young women in projects ranging from the BBC drama ""Fingersmith"" (2005), to feature films like ""Vera Drake"" (2004) and ""The Painted Veil"" (2007). ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" gave her the breakthrough she had long desired, and served as the official announcement of Hawkins' entry into the world of in-demand film actors."
Michael Shannon,"Michael Shannon was a versatile American actor who was best known for his riveting performances in films like ""The Shape of Water"" (2017), ""Take Shelter"" (2011), ""99 Homes"" (2014), and ""Revolutionary Road"" (2008), the latter of which earned Shannon his first Oscar nod. Born in Lexington, Kentucky, Shannon's parents divorced when he was a young boy, so he spent time living in both Lexington and Chicago (his father was a professor at Chicago's DePaul University). Shannon eventually stayed in Chicago and became drawn to the Windy City's thriving theater scene. He started acting in his late teens, and at 19 helped co-found A Red Orchid Theatre in Chicago. Although theater acting was Shannon's first love (he also performed regularly at Chicago's iconic Steppenwolf Theatre), by the mid-90s he began gravitating towards film and acting work. Shannon made a cameo as a groomsman in the 1993 Bill Murray comedy ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), and appeared in two films in 1997: ""The Ride"" and ""Chicago Cab."" By the 2000s Shannon's acting career really began to pick up steam. In addition to appearing in Michael Bay's blockbuster action film ""Pearl Harbor"" in 2001, Shannon would go on to earn praise for his performances in ""8 Mile"" (2002), ""Bug"" (2006), and ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" (2007). In 2008 Shannon played a highly intelligent academic, who's also clinically insane, in the period drama ""Revolutionary Road."" The film, which also starred Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, earned Shannon his first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In the years that followed his role in ""Revolutionary Road,"" Shannon continued earning raves for his performances in films like ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans"" (2009), ""Take Shelter,"" ""Mud"" (2012), and ""99 Homes."" In 2010 he also began earning raves for playing a prohibition-era government agent on HBO's gangster series ""Boardwalk Empire"" (HBO, 2010-14). With his acting career on the rise, Shannon earned his second Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor in 2017 for his role in director Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"" (2016). 2017 was also the year Shannon co-starred in Guillermo del Toro's fantasy drama ""The Shape of Water,"" which would go on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. The following year, in 2018, Shannon starred in two TV mini-series: ""Waco"" (Paramount Network, 2018) and ""The Little Drummer Girl"" (AMC, 2018). By 2019 Shannon had already amassed an impressive body of film and television acting work, but showed no signs of slowing down. That same year he appeared in director Rian Johnson's crime comedy ""Knives Out"" (2019). That film, which centers on an investigation into the death of a family patriarch, was released in late 2019."
Richard Jenkins,"After decades of work in regional theater and made-for-television movies, American character actor Richard Jenkins began to attract the attention of critics and audiences in the late 1990s with quiet but engrossing performances in a wide variety of feature films. Equally capable at both broad comedy and drama, he frequently essayed tightly controlled men of authority, including judges, government agents, detectives and medical professionals. Occasionally, his characters spun wildly out of control - a DEA agent who experiences a spectacular LSD trip in ""Flirting With Disaster"" (1996), or staid funeral director Richard Fisher, whose sudden death reveals a long-hidden secret life on the acclaimed series ""Six Feet Under"" (HBO, 2001-05) - which was often the highlight of the project. He was also a favorite performer of the Coen Brothers, appearing in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (2001), ""Intolerable Cruelty"" (2003) and ""Burn After Reading"" (2008). While mainly a character actor, Jenkins finally graduated to leading man status in the independent film ""The Visitor"" (2008), for which he received excellent notices, while also appearing in ""Eat Pray Love"" (2010) and ""The Rum Diary"" (2011). Though not quite a household name, Jenkins remained a busy actor who landed prominent parts in some of Hollywood's biggest movies."
Octavia Spencer,"Possessing the talent to make even the most minor of roles memorable, Octavia Spencer was a fixture for years on both the small and big screens in supporting roles that called for either a caring nurse or a mouthy blue-collar worker. After making her feature film debut in the crime drama ""A Time to Kill"" (1996), Spencer went on to appear on such popular programs as ""Chicago Hope"" (CBS, 1994-2000), ""The X-Files"" (Fox, 1993-2002), and the hit comedy ""Ugly Betty"" (ABC, 2006-2010). Spencer's perfect timing and natural sass also helped her land roles in feature comedies such as ""Big Momma's House"" (2000) and ""Beauty Shop"" (2005), as well as a breakout role on Comedy Central's ""Halfway Home"" (2007), appearing as a loudmouthed ex-con who is always picking fights with her housemates. After many years of paying her dues as background or supporting players, Spencer garnered much-deserved praise and an Oscar for her glowing performance in ""The Help"" (2011), based on Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel of the same name. She was pitch-perfect as Minny Jackson, a determined and sharp-tongued maid who secretly helps an aspiring writer accurately chronicle the lives of African-American domestics in racially-charged 1960s Mississippi. The high-profile role finally thrust Spencer's talents into the forefront, earning her recognition as a truly multifaceted actress. Roles in films ranging from true-life tale of violence ""Fruitvale Station"" (2013) to dystopian science-fiction thriller ""Snowpiercer"" (2013) to animated smash ""Zootopia"" (2016) followed, as well as a second Oscar nomination for her supporting role in the biopic ""Hidden Figures"" (2016), highlighting a trio of African-American women whose work helped NASA win the Cold War space race."
Michael Stuhlbarg,"While award-winning stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg was known in New York theater circles since the 1990s, he was considered a relative unknown when the Coen Brothers cast him as the lead in their 2009 feature, ""A Serious Man."" Among Stuhlbarg's calling cards were his chameleonic versatility, including his ability (and willingness) to wildly alter his physical appearance, as well as a talent that could toe the line between comedy and tragedy. He appeared in a number of Shakespeare in the Park productions in New York, including starring roles in ""Hamlet"" and ""Richard II,"" and garnered a Tony Award nomination in 2005 for his supporting Broadway role in ""The Pillowman."" Prior to 2009, Stuhlbarg made a few supporting film appearances and found he was curiously at home in period pieces, but it was his  ""Serious Man"" breakout that truly showcased the soulfulness and expressive face of the stage-to-screen crossover talent."
Doug Jones,
Mark Ruffalo,"Like many other actors who were tagged ""best of a generation,"" Mark Ruffalo's roots were in theater and independent film where his honest, open character approach was applauded. His breakout stage role in Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed ""This Is Our Youth"" led Lonergan to give Ruffalo the lead in his film directorial debut ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000), which earned countless festival awards and had critics buzzing about the little-known actor's subtle, compelling performance as a cerebral but aimless young adult with an arrest record and a pregnant teenage girlfriend. Hollywood came courting, but struggled with a tidy niche in which to put the darkly handsome actor; first offering him small but effective character roles as ""conflicted"" types in big budget thrillers like ""Collateral"" (2004) before unsuccessfully making the understated actor into a bland leading man in romantic comedies like ""Just Like Heaven"" (2005). Ruffalo eventually found an appropriate arena somewhere between the multiplex and the art house, favored by character-driven directors like Jane Campion, David Fincher, Steven Zaillian and eventually Martin Scorsese - all of whom capitalized on the actor's talent for believably disappearing into complex, empathetic characters."
Michael Keaton,"Though he began his career in stand-up comedy, intense actor Michael Keaton blossomed into a multi-talented performer comfortable in comedies, gritty dramas and big budget action movies. At first, he used his manic onscreen persona to great effect in early hits like ""Night Shift"" (1982) and ""Mr. Mom"" (1983); the former of which put him on the map, while the latter turned him into a star. But it was his wild turn as a perverse ghost in Tim Burton's ""Beetlejuice"" (1988) and his compelling dramatic performance as a cocaine addict trying to get his life together in ""Clean and Sober"" (1988) that showcased his true talents. Keaton reached new heights when he won the title role in Burton's take on ""Batman"" (1989). His casting surprised many - and angered some - though when the finished film was released, most were in agreement that Keaton's brooding performance was inspired. After the inevitable sequel, ""Batman Returns"" (1992), Keaton's career entered a commercial and critical downturn with films like ""Jack Frost"" (1998), or little-seen indies like ""Quicksand"" (2001) that barely saw the light of day. He emerged onto the small screen with an acclaimed turn in ""Live from Bagdad"" (HBO, 2002), a reminder that Keaton was capable of handling any role in any genre or medium. After settling into a solid career as a character actor, Keaton returned to public consciousness with a career-redefining role in the Oscar-winning ""Birdman"" (2014). Further work in another Best Picture winner, ""Spotlight"" (2015), Ray Kroc biopic ""The Founder"" (2016) and superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) proved that Michael Keaton had managed a late-career renaissance."
Rachel McAdams,
Liev Schreiber,"Liev Schreiber was a highly respected stage and screen actor whose deep voice and serious countenance lent itself well to playing intense, dramatic roles. He came to prominence in the late 1990s after a long string of performances in indie features, and gained widespread notice as town loner and red herring Cotton Weary in Wes Craven's ""Scream"" (1996) and its two sequels. The exposure helped usher him into more mainstream projects, such the HBO TV movie ""RKO 281"" (1999), for which he played Orson Welles; the Tom Clancy adventure ""The Sum of All Fears"" (2002); and  the cable series ""Ray Donovan"" (Showtime 2013- ). Off camera, Schreiber was a Tony Award winner and veteran of numerous New York stage productions, making his directorial debut with an adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's ""Everything is Illuminated"" (2005), proving that he possessed talents far beyond simply acting."
John Slattery,"A well-respected and prolific stage actor throughout the 1990s, John Slattery broke into screen acting at the end of the 1980s and endured several failed series and guest spots in television movies and the occasional feature film. Recurring roles on a string of high-profile programs like ""Will and Grace"" (NBC, 1998-2006), ""Sex and the City"" (HBO, 1998-2004), ""Ed"" (NBC, 2000-04) and ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC, 2004-2012) made him a casting agent's go-to for flinty and occasionally unyielding authority figures. Appearances in major motion pictures like ""Traffic"" (2000), ""Flags of Our Fathers"" (2006) and ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (2007) preceded perhaps his most widely-recognized character, playing the hard-drinking, chain-smoking philanderer and advertising executive Roger Sterling on ""Mad Men"" (AMC, 2007-2015). Exuding a devil-may-care attitude and old school charm, Slattery's performance earned him considerable acclaim and status as one of the show's favorite characters. Because of his newfound prominence, Slattery was rewarded with supporting turns in big movies like ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and a profile that was finally on the rise."
Brian d'Arcy James,"Brian d'Arcy James worked in a variety of genres and built up a diverse and reputable career. Early on, James landed roles on various television dramas, including ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" (1999-), ""The Education of Max Bickford"" (2001-02) and ""Rescue Me"" (2003-2011). He appeared in a number of television specials, including ""The Kennedy Center Honors"" (1997-98) and ""The Rodgers & Hart Story: Thou Swell, Thou Witty"" (1998-99). James mainly acted in films like the crime picture ""Exiled"" (1999) with Paul Ronan during the early stages of his career. He continued to work steadily in television throughout the early 2000s and the 2010s, appearing on ""The Good Wife"" (2009-16) and ""Person of Interest"" (2011-16). He appeared in ""G"" (2005) with Richard T Jones and ""Ghost Town"" (2008) in the early 2000s and the 2010s. He spent the 2010s tackling film roles in the Jennifer Westfeldt drama ""Friends With Kids"" (2012), the holiday ""The Fitzgerald Family Christmas"" (2012) with Kerry Bishe and the Tina Fey comedic drama ""Admission"" (2013). He also appeared in ""Spotlight"" (2015) with Mark Ruffalo. He also worked in television during these years, including a part on ""Ironside"" (2013-14). Most recently, James acted in the Richard Gere drama ""Time Out of Mind"" (2015)."
Amy Adams,"Amy Adams was an Oscar-nominated American actress who was best known for her extraordinary work in numerous critically-acclaimed films, including ""Junebug"" (2005), ""Doubt"" (2008), ""The Master"" (2012), and ""Arrival"" (2016). Adams grew up in a big family (she was the fourth of seven siblings) and due to her father's career in the United States Army, she moved around a lot as a child. She was born on a military complex in Italy, and continued moving with her parents and siblings from one Army base to the next throughout the early part of her childhood. When she was 8 years-old, Amy's parents finally put some permanent roots down in Castle Rock, Colorado. It was around this time that Adams first discovered her love for performing. She described her family as not having a lot of money, so to entertain themselves they would often put on skits. Amy was always cast as the lead, and quickly found that she loved acting in front of an audience. When she entered high school, Adams, who was never a good student, started training as a ballerina. She had aspirations of going pro, but by the time she graduated at 18, Adams realized that a professional ballerina career was not in the cards. After high school ended, Adams moved to Atlanta, Georgia with her mother. It was there that she renewed her childhood passion for acting by getting involved in community theater. One of her first productions during this period was a part in a local production of the musical ""Annie."" The rush of energy she received from being on stage was enough to convince Adams that she had found her life's calling. From there, she began taking on more roles in community theater. By the mid-1990s Adams was doing dinner theater in places like Boulder, Colorado and Chanhassen, Minnesota, which allowed her to hone her craft night after night. It was also during this period that Adams worked waitressing jobs to make some extra cash. Then in the late 90s, when she was living in Minnesota, Adams went to a local audition for a new film called ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" (1999). The film was a satire on beauty pageants, and starred Kristen Dunst and Kirstie Alley. After auditioning for the role, Adams was cast in a supporting role as an over-sexed cheerleader named Leslie Miller. After landing the part in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" Adams moved to Los Angeles where she began auditioning for whatever roles came her way. She nabbed guest spots on TV shows like ""That 70s Show"" (Fox, 1998-2006) and ""Smallville"" (The WB/The CW, 2001-2011), as well as a substantial part in the Steven Spielberg film ""Catch Me if You Can"" (2002). After a few years in L.A., however, Adams was growing frustrated and was seriously contemplating quitting acting for good. With her career prospects looking grim, Adams decided to take a chance by accepting a role in an independent comedy-drama called ""Junebug."" Adams felt an instant connection with her character, a chatty pregnant woman named Ashley Johnsten, and her performance earned her heaps of critical praise. As a result, Adams was nominated for her first acting Oscar for ""Junebug."" With her stock on the rise after the huge success of ""Junebug,"" Adams started getting offers to play the kind of roles she always wanted to play. And over the next several years, she would win over critics and audiences alike for her sterling performances in films like ""Enchanted"" (2007), ""Doubt,"" ""The Fighter"" (2010), and ""The Master."" In 2013 Adams begin playing the fictional Lois Lane, the love interest of Superman, in the superhero film ""Man of Steel"" (2013). It was a role she would reprise in two additional superhero films: ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) and ""Justice League"" (2017). By the late 2010s, Adams's career showed no signs of slowing down. She earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for her role in ""Sharp Objects"" (HBO, 2018), which was based on a novel by Gillian Flynn, and also played Lynne Cheney, the wife of the former Vice President Dick Cheney, in Adam McKay's comedy biopic ""Vice"" (2018). Her role as Cheney earned Adams her sixth Oscar nomination, thus lending even more credence to Amy Adam's already defined status as one of the most celebrated actresses of her generation."
Jeremy Renner,"After years of struggle, actor Jeremy Renner earned a reputation as a reliable lead in dark-themed dramas, thanks initially to his stellar portrayal of infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in the biopic, ""Dahmer"" (2002). With no qualms about taking a turn to the dark side, Renner added to his esteem with acclaimed indie turns as a white supremacist in ""Neo Ned"" (2005) and a sexist boss in ""North Country"" (2005). He tackled more complex roles with sterling performances as a former L.A.P.D. cop in ""S.W.A.T."" (2003) and as the intimidating Wood Hite, cousin to Frank and Jesse James, in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007). Though a recognizable face, Renner finally broke through as a household name following his critically lauded turn as an on-edge bomb disposal expert operating in the Oscar-winning Iraq War thriller, ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009). From there, he earned himself an Oscar nomination with a finely tuned turn as a career criminal in Ben Affleck's widely hailed crime drama, ""The Town"" (2010), which soon led to roles in blockbuster movies like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), ""The Avengers"" (2011) and ""The Bourne Legacy"" (2012). With each critical nod, Renner secured a firmer footing in Hollywood as a recognizable and dependable face in a variety of feature films."
Forest Whitaker,"Though actor Forest Whitaker started college on an athletic scholarship, the charismatic and award-winning performer made the unlikely shift from football to studying to become a classical tenor and eventually, an actor. After gaining some attention in several stage musicals, Whitaker made an immediate impression with a small, but memorable role in his feature debut, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982). Following a quick succession of supporting roles in features and on television, he earned his first wave of critical accolades for his portrayal of drug-addicted jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker in ""Bird"" (1988). Once he was established as a viable leading man, Whitaker easily oscillated between low-budget and studio projects, earning equal acclaim for his performances. Taking his career to the next level, he made several forays into feature directing - most notably ""Waiting to Exhale"" (1995) - but continued to churn out one sterling performance after another until finally reaching new heights with his Oscar-winning portrayal of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland"" (2006), which came hot on the heels of another mesmerizing performance as an obsessive internal affairs officer on season five of ""The Shield"" (FX, 2002-08). Both roles only confirmed that Whitaker was one of Hollywood's most versatile, surprising and talented actors of his day. His work as a producer on films like ""Fruitvale Station"" (2013) and ""Dope"" (2015) helped shepherd a new generation of African-American filmmakers while his work in hits like ""The Butler"" (2013), ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" (2016) and ""Black Panther"" (2018) kept him firmly in audiences' minds."
Michael Stuhlbarg,"While award-winning stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg was known in New York theater circles since the 1990s, he was considered a relative unknown when the Coen Brothers cast him as the lead in their 2009 feature, ""A Serious Man."" Among Stuhlbarg's calling cards were his chameleonic versatility, including his ability (and willingness) to wildly alter his physical appearance, as well as a talent that could toe the line between comedy and tragedy. He appeared in a number of Shakespeare in the Park productions in New York, including starring roles in ""Hamlet"" and ""Richard II,"" and garnered a Tony Award nomination in 2005 for his supporting Broadway role in ""The Pillowman."" Prior to 2009, Stuhlbarg made a few supporting film appearances and found he was curiously at home in period pieces, but it was his  ""Serious Man"" breakout that truly showcased the soulfulness and expressive face of the stage-to-screen crossover talent."
Mark O'Brien,
Tzi Ma,"The Hong Kong-born Tzi Ma, who studied theatre and dance in America, has proven that Asian men can carve out a successful niche in Hollywood, even if they aren't action superstars like Jackie Chan or Jet Li. One of his earliest roles to gain notice was as the main heavy in 1992's ""Rapid Fire,"" in which he fought hand-to-hand on an elevated train platform with Brandon Lee, son of the legendary Bruce Lee. But for most of the decade, it was just as common to see Ma in roles that didn't require kung-fu kicks; he was effective in the 1994 drama ""Golden Gate"" (written by David Henry Hwang, with whom he collaborated numerous times for the stage) and on ""NYPD Blue"" in the recurring part of Detective Harold Ng. In 2002, he played a shadowy assistant to Michael Caine's British journalist in ""The Quiet American,"" one of the more critically acclaimed films of the year. This gave his career a boost, and he subsequently landed his highest-profile film yet: the Coen Brothers' 2004 remake of ""The Ladykillers,"" which allowed Ma to show off a more comedic side. During this time, he was also active in independent film, playing a retiree desperately trying to hide a dark secret from his three grown daughters in ""Red Doors."" As for television work, Ma appeared in the series ""24"" as Cheng Zhi, a Chinese official who matches wits and wills, as opposed to fists, with protagonist Jack Bauer."
Hugh Jackman,"A stage and screen actor of remarkable versatility, Australia-born Hugh Jackman had the unusual honor of being named one of People magazine's ""Sexiest Men Alive,"" while also maintaining fandom among legions of comic book enthusiasts for portraying famed X-Men character Wolverine. After receiving his start in film and on television in his native Australia, Jackman was catapulted to stardom as the edgy, violence-prone Wolverine in the blockbuster hit ""X-Men"" (2000), a role he reprised over the course of his career in sequels like ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009) and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) before closing the books on his performance in the R-rated finale ""Logan"" (2017). In between, he earned critical acclaim for his performance in the romantic comedy ""Kate & Leopold"" (2001), played a computer-hacking criminal in the thriller ""Swordfish"" (2001) and cut down vampires as ""Van Helsing"" (2004). After starring in Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" (2006) and Darren Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" (2006), Jackman joined fellow Aussies Nicole Kidman and Baz Luhrmann for the romantic epic ""Australia"" (2008). A veteran of the musical stage, Jackman was a natural fit to serve as host of the Tony Awards and Academy Awards, while also starring in the long-awaited adaptation of ""Les Misérables"" (2012) and appearing as Blackbeard in the Peter Pan reimagining ""Pan"" (2015) and P.T. Barnum in the musical drama ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017). Because of his rugged charm and diversity of talent, Jackman capably alternated between great displays of theatricality and calculated reserve while becoming one of Hollywood's favored leading men."
Patrick Stewart,"Equally at home on stage or screen, Sir Patrick Stewart beamed into the public's consciousness as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (Syndicated, 1987-94) and never left. Born in Yorkshire, England, he began acting as a youngster, attending the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in his mid-20s, performing with fellow future stars Ben Kingsley and Helen Mirren. He made his screen debut in an episode of ""Story Parade"" (BBC, 1964-65) but primarily concentrated on his stage career until the early-1970s. After gaining notice for his RSC performances in ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Antony and Cleopatra,"" he was cast in the Russian play ""The Love Girl and the Innocent"" for an episode of ""BBC Play of the Month"" (BBC, 1965-83). His stage work crossed over to the screen as well when he recreated his acclaimed portrayal of Enobarbus for ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (ITVC, 1974). On television, he starred in the miniseries ""North & South"" (BBC, 1975) and appeared as Sejanus in ""I, Claudius"" (BBC2, 1976). While still performing regularly on stage, he continued acting occasionally on television, including playing Claudius in a production of ""Hamlet, Prince of Denmark"" (BBC, 1980) and joined the cast of the big screen King Arthur epic ""Excalibur"" (1981). He was cast as the lead in the series ""Maybury"" (BBC2, 1981-83) playing psychiatrist Dr. Edward Roebuck. Stewart also appeared in David Lynch's big-budget adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-novel ""Dune"" (1984). He would soon, though, find a role that would catapult him to lasting fame. After the success of the ""Star Trek"" films of the 1980s, the creator of the original TV series, Gene Roddenberry created a follow-up, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" with Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. The show weathered some early bumps to eventually find a rabid and loyal following, thanks in large part to Stewart's commanding performance. It became one of the most successful syndicated shows in television history, winning Hugo and Peabody awards. While appearing on ""Next Generation,"" he continued making stage appearances, including starring in a one-man adaptation of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" that would become a recurring part of his career. After his series ended, the actor followed the role to the big screen in ""Star Trek Generations"" (1994), getting a chance to appear on screen with his ""Star Trek"" predecessor, William Shatner's James T. Kirk. He showed a markedly different side when he appeared with Steven Weber in the film adaptation of Paul Rudnick's play ""Jeffrey"" (1995) playing a gay decorator whose partner is infected with AIDS. He returned to playing Picard for ""Star Trek: First Contact"" (1996). He went on to star in the comedy ""Masterminds"" (1997) and play Captain Ahab in ""Moby Dick"" (USA Network, 1998). Another return to the Enterprise in ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" (1998) followed, along with a TV version of his stage performance of Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"" (TNT, 1999). As the 21st Century arrived, Stewart found another role that would nearly match Picard. Bryan Singer cast the actor as Professor Charles Xavier, leader of a group of superhero mutants, in ""X-Men"" (2000) based on the popular Marvel comic book. For a time, he was leading two film franchises, appearing in ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002) and ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003). On television, he joined Glenn Close for a retelling of ""The Lion in Winter"" (Showtime, 2003). He also starred with Kyle Machlachlan in Jules Verne's ""Mysterious Island"" (Hallmark, 2005) and in the miniseries ""Eleventh Hour"" (ITV, 2006). He rejoined his mutant cohorts in the sequel ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006). His sonorous vocal style made him a natural for voice work and the actor racked up numerous credits, including lending his talents to shows like ""Family Guy"" (Fox, 1999- ) and ""Robot Chicken"" (Cartoon Network, 2005- ). Stewart returned to his Shakespearian roots with a Tony-nominated turn in ""Macbeth"" and joining David Tennant for ""Hamlet"" (BBC2, 2009). He appeared as well with his ""X-Men"" co-star Ian McKellen in a production of ""Waiting for Godot."" Not everything was quite so highbrow, as the actor starred in the comedy ""Hunting Elephants"" (2013). After starring as a Juilliard dance professor in ""Match"" (2014), he reteamed with McKellen for another mutant adventure. His Professor X and McKellen's Magneto shared the screen with their younger versions, played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014). The actor also starred in the holiday comedy ""Christmas Eve"" (2015) and the series ""Blunt Talk"" (Starz, 2015-16). He had a chance to play Charles Xavier one more time, starring with Hugh Jackman in ""Logan"" (2017). He starred with Close and John Malkovich in ""The Wilde Wedding"" (2017) and played Merlin in ""The Kid Who Would Be King"" (2019). After appearing in the reboot of ""Charlie's Angels"" (2019). Stewart returned to the role that first made him famous. The actor played an older Jean-Luc Picard in ""Star Trek: Picard"" (CBS All-Access: 2020- )."
Dafne Keen,"Dafne Keen was a British-Spanish actress born on January 19, 2005. The daughter of actor Will Keen and actress, theater director, and writer María Fernández Ache, Dafne was also the paternal great-granddaughter of Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe, a member of the English peerage. Known for his roles in ""Victor Frankenstein"" (2015) and ""The Crown"" (Netflix, 2016-), Will Keen acted alongside his daughter in her acting and television debut, ""The Refugees"" (laSexta, 2015). The British-Spanish co-production followed a massive group of refugees time traveling to the past to avoid a deadly virus; both father and daughter were a part of the main cast. Dafne Keen landed her breakout role (and her film debut) as Laura in ""Logan"" (2017), the conclusion of Hugh Jackman's run as the iconic Marvel Comics and X-Men character Wolverine. As his mutant daughter (claws run in the family), Keen received critical praise. She then joined the television adaptation of Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" (BBC One, TBA) as main character Lyra, appearing alongside her father Will once again."
Richard E. Grant,"Character actor Richard E. Grant crafted a career that saw him equally at home in projects as disparate as ""Game of Thrones"" (HBO, 2011-) and ""Downton Abbey"" (ITV, 2010-15). Born in Mbabane, Eswatini, he began his acting career in Cape Town, South Africa before relocating to England. After a small role in the sitcom ""Sweet Sixteen"" (BBC, 1983), he quickly jumped into the deep end. Playing the frequently drunk title character in Bruce Robinson's ""Withnail & I"" (1987), Grant was at the center of what would quickly become a cult classic. He teamed again with Robinson for the oddball comedy ""How to Get Ahead in Advertising"" (1989), about a marketing executive with a boil that talks. The work caught Hollywood's attention, and he was soon acting in high-profile fare like ""L.A. Story"" (1991), with Steve Martin, and Robert Altman's ""The Player"" (1992). He also starred in the Academy Award-winning short ""Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life"" (1995). Drawing upon his classical training, he played Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Trevor Nunn's big screen adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night or What You Will"" (1996) opposite Helena Bonham Carter. He found himself exposed to a completely different kind of audience when he joined the pop group Spice Girls in ""Spice World"" (1998). He worked steadily, including playing classic characters such as Bob Cratchit in ""A Christmas Carol"" (TNT, 1999) and the namesake hero in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (BBC, 1999-2000). He began his first brush with the sci-fi classic ""Doctor Who"" (BBC, 2005-) when he appeared with Rowan Atkinson in the comedy short ""Doctor Who - The Curse of Fatal Death"" (BBC, 1999). He went on to voice the Doctor in an animated project ""Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka"" (BBC, 2003), and then later played the villainous Great Intelligence in the main series. His work in television included recurring roles on ""Downton Abbey"" playing art historian Simon Bricker and as Jasper in ""Girls"" (HBO, 2012-17). He also had a memorable appearance in ""Game of Thrones"" playing the egotistical actor Izembaro. He found a fresh round of acclaim for his talents when he joined Melissa McCarthy for ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" (2018). Playing McCarthy's partner in a scam to sell forged letters from literary greats, Grant earned critical raves and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The stellar notices didn't slow him at all. He continued working, appearing on television in the sitcom ""Hang Ups"" (Channel 4, 2018-) and ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" (Netflix, 2017-19), and in the Disney film ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" (2018). He then carved out a place in yet another sci-fi classic with a starring role in ""Star Wars: Episode IX"" (2019)."
Doris Morgado,
Boyd Holbrook,"Boyd Holbrook was an American actor and model whose film credits include ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" (2014) and the searing biopic ""Milk"" (2008). The son of Ellen and Don Holbrook, he was born on September 1, 1981 in the small county seat of Prestonsburg, Kentucky. Holbrook's natural good looks took him to the world of modeling, first signing with Elite Models agency in 2001. He worked with numerous agencies and modeled all over Europe and Asia for designers such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and Hugo Boss. With the money he saved up from his days as a fashion model, Holbrook studied film at New York University where he earned an SCSP Certificate in 16mm film. Ambition turned to good fortune for Holbrook in 2007 when he sent an original screenplay to director Gus Van Sant. Impressed by his work, Van Sant cast him in his movie ""Milk,"" a biographical film about the late gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. The film was a critical success and won Best Original Screenplay at the 2009 Academy Awards. Holbrook next had the opportunity to work with both Academy Award-winner Kevin Costner and Golden Globe nominee Bill Paxton in the History Channel's three-part television miniseries ""Hatfields & McCoys"" (2012). In 2013, he was seen playing Kyle O'Shea in the film adaptation of Twilight author Stephenie Meyer's science fiction novel ""The Host,"" and Cary James in Steven Soderbergh's drama ""Behind the Candelabra"" (HBO 2013) which starred Michael Douglas and Matt Damon as Liberace and his lover Scott Thorson. Holbrook's filmography grew rapidly the following year, appearing in four movies that included ""The Skeleton Twins"" (2014), a critically-acclaimed comedy-drama starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" (2014), an adaptation of one of Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder detective novels starring Liam Neeson, romantic comedy ""Very Good Girls"" (2014) and David Fincher's hit ""Gone Girl"" (2014). The following year, Holbrook starred in ""Narcos"" (Netflix 2015- ), a thriller set in the Latin American drug trade."

Samuel L. Jackson,"Although starting out with small roles and trouble with the law, Samuel L. Jackson has since become a highly sought after actor and film producer.  Born in Washington, D.C.,he was a student activist at Morehouse College and served as an usher at the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His protests led to his being arrested and convicted of unlawful confinement. After finishing college, he moved to New York where his early stage and television career was stunted by substance abuse issues. After a number of small parts on television in the early '80s, Jackson's career finally began to find true traction thanks to his relationship with Spike Lee. The director cast him in parts in ""School Daze"" (1988),""Do the Right Thing"" (1989), and ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990). Along with small, but memorable roles, in ""Coming to America"" (1988) and Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (1990), his profile in the industry began increasing. His true breakout came due to another collaboration with Lee. After having just completed a rehabilitation program for cocaine and heroin addiction, Jackson garnered critical raves as the drug-addicted brother of Wesley Snipes' architect in ""Jungle Fever"" (1991). His film roles increased steadily, including parts in Steven Spielberg's blockbuster ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and opposite Harrison Ford in the thriller ""Patriot Games"" (1992). It was a relationship with another director, however, that put the actor on the map for good. Having worked with Quentin Tarantino on ""True Romance"" (1993), he was cast in the filmmaker's seminal ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). Playing the Scripture-quoting hitman Jules, alongside John Travolta, the actor was swept up in a pop culture phenomenon. From then on, Jackson became an in-demand film actor. His high profile roles included joining Bruce Willis for ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) and reteaming with Tarantino for ""Jackie Brown"" (1997). He also joined sci-fi lore by playing Jedi Master Mace Windu in George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" prequels, ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999), ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002), and ""Revenge of the Sith"" (2005). M. Night Shyamalan paired the actor once again with Willis for the supernatural thriller ""Unbreakable"" (2000) - a film that would eventually get a sequel 19 years later starring the pair again in ""Glass"" (2019). He later became one of the mainstays of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury. Beginning in ""Iron Man"" (2008) and continuing through the international blockbusters of ""The Avengers"" (2012) series and appearing as a younger version of the character in ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), Jackson played the hero to the point of becoming synonymous with the character. The actor continued his relationship with Tarantino as well, appearing in the director's ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015). Jackson's standing as an action star continued deep into his career as well, playing John Shaft in both ""Shaft"" (2000) and the sequel ""Shaft"" (2019), and teaming with Ryan Reynolds for ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" (2017) and ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" (2020)."
Jake Gyllenhaal,"Despite his pedigree as a child of show biz, actor Jake Gyllenhaal earned his spot as one of Hollywood's leading performers purely by way of his merits. With screenwriter and director parents, and an equally talented and famous actor sister, Gyllenhaal used his inherent intelligence and sensitivity to make his name in independent films. As a teenager, Gyllenhaal lent a subtle, soulful sense of complicated youth to a number of acclaimed art-house titles, including ""Donnie Darko"" (2001), which emerged as a hit from the 2001 Sundance Film Festival and paved the way for his future career. As he matured into his twenties, Gyllenhaal was increasingly in demand for a wide range of material - from the small-town-set indie ""The Good Girl"" (2002) to Roland Emmerich's tentpole blockbuster ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004). He delivered one of his best performances in arguably the most controversial movie of his career, ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), which earned him his greatest critical acclaim to date. From there, Gyllenhaal developed into a prominent leading actor capable of turning in understated performances as he did as a San Francisco Chronicle reporter obsessively chasing down a killer in ""Zodiac"" (2007), while holding his own opposite Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin in ""Rendition"" (2007). Though he stumbled in his first blockbuster starring role with ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" (2010), Gyllenhaal remained a bankable star possessing the ability to excel in a myriad of different film genres. His compelling against-type performance in the noirish drama ""Nightcrawler"" (2014) was critically acclaimed, and was followed by star turns in boxing drama ""Southpaw"" (2015) and action drama ""Everest"" (2015)."
Marisa Tomei,"For some performers, winning an Oscar became both a blessing and a curse. While an Academy Award could lead to bigger and better roles, it could also bring about career stagnation, as the actor tried to live up to unrealistic expectations. Actress Marisa Tomei was in danger of failing to warrant the hype after seemingly coming out of nowhere to nab Best Supporting Actress for her comical performance in ""My Cousin Vinny"" (1992). Though she spent the following years in little-seen movies like ""Only You"" (1994) and ""Happy Accidents"" (2000), Tomei also delivered powerful performances in indie dramas ""Unhook the Stars"" (1996) and ""The Slums of Beverly Hills"" (1998), but they failed to propel her career due to slim box office performances. She proved her talent and career longevity, however, with her Oscar-nominated, subtle but complex turns in ""In the Bedroom"" (2001) and ""The Wrestler"" (2008), as well as strong performances in films ranging from romantic comedy ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" (2011) to barbed satire ""The Big Short"" (2015) proving her worth to critics who had cruelly deemed her win for ""My Cousin Vinny"" to be a fluke, vindicating fans and critics who recognized her considerable talents all along."
Jon Favreau,"Actor, producer, writer and director Jon Favreau hit unlikely pay dirt when ""Swingers"" (1996), his low-budget, autobiographical indie about struggling young actors, turned he and co-star/real-life best friend Vince Vaughn into hot property seemingly overnight. Favreau parlayed his rising profile into a number of supporting big-screen roles as cynical side men, but he was more anxious to get behind the camera and direct bigger features. After another indie buddy comedy with Vaughn, mob farce ""Made"" (2001), Favreau went wide with the holiday hit ""Elf"" (2003), starring a spandex-clad Will Ferrell. His acclaimed adaptation of the kids book ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) missed the mark with audiences, but his 2008 adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Iron Man"" starring Robert Downey, Jr. was one of the most anticipated action films of the year, leading to a return to leading man status for Downey, Jr. and hard-won blockbuster credentials for its highly creative director. Along with continuing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a producer and actor (playing Tony Stark's personal assistant Happy Hogan), Favreau found further success as a director through films as varied as the romantic comedy-drama ""Chef"" (2014) and the CGI blockbusters ""The Jungle Book"" (2016) and ""The Lion King"" (2019)."
Zendaya,"As both a singer and an actress, Zendaya Coleman (who usually dropped her surname professionally) earned stardom at a very young age, thanks to her leading role on the children's sitcom ""Shake It Up!"" (Disney Chanel, 2010-13). Zendaya was born on Sept. 1, 1996 in Oakland, CA, where her mother worked as a stage manager and children's acting coach at the California Shakespeare Theater. While performing in numerous productions, Zendaya attended the Oakland School of the Arts before studying at the CalShakes Conservatory Program and the American Conservatory Theater, earning credits in productions of ""Richard III,"" ""As You Like It"" and ""Twelfth Night."" From there, the talented young actress modeled for Macy's, Old Navy, and Sears, before appearing in the music video of Kidz Bop cover of Katy Perry's ""Hot n Cold"" (2009). Zendaya soon landed the role of aspiring dancer Rocky Blue on ""Shake It Up!"" while launching her music career with the singles ""Swag it Out"" (2011) and ""Watch Me"" (2011). After making her film debut in the Disney-made ""Frenemies"" (2012), she released her third single, ""Something to Dance For"" (2012), and in 2013 was announced as a contestant on the 16th season of ""Dancing with the Stars"" (ABC, 2005- ). In 2014, Coleman was chosen to play the late singer and actress Aaliyah in a biopic, but following a social media outcry over the light-skinned Coleman portraying the darker-complexioned Aaliyah, the actress bowed out of the production, claiming creative differences and worries over the film's music rights. After starring in the TV film ""Zapped"" (Disney 2014), Zendaya starred in the sitcom ""KC Undercover"" (Disney 2015- ) as teenage spy K.C. Cooper. She made her big-screen debut in the superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017), followed by a supporting role in P.T. Barnum biopic ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017)."
Kumail Nanjiani,"A comedic jack of all trades, Kumail Nanjiani never forgot his Pakistani roots even while riffing on the all-American life he had created for himself. He wrote for some of the hippest and most ground-breaking TV comedies of his era, and still found time to co-host a podcast about the nerd world of video games while putting together a weekly live show that helped put Los Angeles back on the map of stand-up. Born in Karachi, Pakistan in 1978, Nanjiani moved to Iowa with his family when he was 18. In college, he first discovered stand-up by listening to his uncle's tapes of comedy acts, and he became obsessed. By his junior year in college he began doing his own stand-up routines. His major in computer sciences, gave him a solid nerd-culture base for his act as he drifted slowly into the comedy world of New York City. He worked briefly as a writer on ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ), but his work on the short-lived sketch program ""Michael and Michael Have Issues"" (Comedy Central 2009) gave him his first taste of acting. The producers wanted the writers to also have bit parts on the show, and Nanjiani discovered that the acting informed his writing, and the writing improved his acting. Along with his burgeoning stand-up career, Nanjiani had small roles in the films ""Life As We Know It"" (2010) and ""The Five Year Engagement"" (2012). During this era, Nanjiani moved from New York to Los Angeles, where podcast impresario Chris Hardwick invited him to create a show about comic books. Since he knew video games much better, he convinced Hardwick to center the show on video game obsessions. The podcast, The Indoor Kids, was co-hosted by Nanjiani's wife, comic and writer Emily V. Gordon. As if the television appearances, movies and podcasts weren't enough, Nanjiani also started co-hosting a weekly stand-up show in the back room of a Los Angeles comic book store called The Meltdown alongside fellow comic Jonah Ray. The show, which featured rising and known comics doing new, improvisational and experimental material, was so successful that in 2014 Comedy Central signed it up to become one of the network's live comedy showcases; the shows ended in 2016 when the pair's other duties began taking too much of their time. Nanjiani also continued to act, appearing regularly as various characters on Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein's offbeat comedy series ""Portlandia"" (IFC 2011- ) and taking on a co-starring role in Mike Judge's satirical series ""Silicon Valley"" (HBO 2014- ). Nanjiani and Gordon branched into screenwriting with ""The Big Sick"" (2017), an autobiographical comedy about their courtship that starred Nanjiani as himself and Zoe Kazan as Emily."
Zoe Kazan,
Holly Hunter,"Petite, fiery, and altogether confident, Holly Hunter was an Academy Award-winning actress and producer who rose to prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a string of roles in challenging and critically acclaimed films. After a series of supporting roles, Hunter had her first starring role in the Coen Brothers' comedy ""Raising Arizona"" (1987), and that same year, she also earned an Oscar nod for her performance in ""Broadcast News"" (1987). Following an Emmy-winning turn as a fictionalized Jane Roe in ""Roe v. Wade"" (NBC, 1989), Hunter earned the biggest accolades of her career - as well as a Best Actress Oscar - for her renowned performance as a mute pianist in ""The Piano"" (1993). From there, she delivered quality supporting and leading turns in ""The Firm"" (1993), ""A Life Less Ordinary"" (1997), ""Crash"" (1997) and ""Jesus' Son"" (1999). In the new millennium, Hunter was exemplary as a frustrated mother in ""Thirteen"" (2003) and enjoyed voicing Elastigirl in the Pixar hit ""The Incredibles"" (2004). She stepped away from the big screen to star in the short-lived, but critically acclaimed cable series ""Saving Grace"" (TNT, 2007-2010), proving that her extraordinary talents could make the successful transition to the small screen."
Ray Romano,"In his early days as a stand-up comic, Ray Romano won over audiences with his New York accent and his deadpan delivery of domestic humor and observations. When he translated that accessible, everyday-guy persona into a sitcom, he made television history with ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" (CBS, 1996-2005), one of the best-loved, most critically acclaimed sitcoms of the era. A Top 10 ratings earner for over half of its nine-year run, the show's success was rooted in its outstanding ensemble cast and its relatable focus on the minutiae of family life, with adults taking center stage. The show transformed Romano into one of the top TV stars of the day, with a best-selling memoir and a Grammy-nominated comedy album to complete the picture. When he ventured out onto the big screen, however, it was hit-or-miss, with several failed attempts at buddy comedies and darker independent films but blockbuster success arrived in the shape of Manny, the wooly mammoth who Romano amusingly voiced in the animated ""Ice Age"" franchise. In the wake of nearly a decade spent on the CBS sitcom he created, Romano branched out in 2009 with another primetime project, ""Men of a Certain Age"" (TNT, 2009-11). The hourlong comic drama proved that Romano could ably inhabit less autobiographical material than his previous hit, yet still draw in audiences with his intensely likable persona and timeless wit."
Anupam Kher,"Anupam Kher was an internationally recognized Indian actor who in addition to appearing in hundreds of successful films in his native India, also became recognized all over the world for his roles in critically acclaimed films like ""Bend It Like Beckham"" (2002), ""Lust, Caution"" (2007) and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012). Born and raised in the Indian city of Shimla, Kher grew up in relatively modest upbringings. However, he always had a desire to become a professional actor. Thus, when he was of age Kher moved to New Delhi to study acting at the prestigious National School of Drama. After graduation Kher moved to Mumbai to pursue his acting career in earnest. The early days of his career were full of intense struggle and sacrifice. While attempting to chart his own course in the thriving Indian film industry, Kher had no money and had to sleep on train station platforms because he couldn't afford an apartment. His luck would change, however, in 1982 after he landed his first role in the Indian film ""Apmaan"" (1982). It was the beginning of a thriving film career that would include hundreds of roles in Indian films over the course of the next thirty-plus years. By the early 2000s, with his film acting in career in India thriving, Kher began widening his appeal by appearing in international films. In addition to appearing in the critically acclaimed ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" Kher also nabbed parts in the equally as popular ""Lust, Caution"" (2007) and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" With his acting career in both India and throughout the world on the rise, Kher continued working steadily throughout the 2010s. In the United States he became a recognizable face for his recurring part on the Netflix science fiction series ""Sense8"" (Netflix, 2015-18), as well for his supporting role in the 2017 Oscar-nominated comedy-drama ""The Big Sick"" (2017). Furthermore, Kher added to his resume of appearing in English language films and television shows by appearing in a recurring role on the BBC mini-series ""Mrs. Wilson"" (BBC, 2018). ""Mrs. Wilson,"" which is set in both India and London throughout the 1930s to the 1960s, premiered on the BBC in 2018."

Olivia Colman,"Olivia Colman was a prolific and widely respected British television and film actress who earned her first Oscar in 2019 for her role as Queen Anne in the biographical comedy-drama ""The Favourite"" (2018). Born and raised in the historic city of Norwich, England, Colman was inspired by her mother, who pursued ballet dancing as a young woman, to embark on a career in the arts. With that in mind, Colman decided to translate her love of performers and performing into the pursuit of a professional acting career. She started young, and by her mid-teens Colman was nabbing lead roles in school plays. When it came time to enter college, Colman briefly put her acting aspirations on hold to study primary teaching at Homerton College in Cambridge. However, her time at the college would prove to be short-lived. Colman wanted to be an actress after all, so she left Homerton and began studying drama at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. After graduating from the school in 1999, Colman began working almost immediately. She started out appearing primarily on television, with supporting roles on shows like ""Mr. Charity"" (BBC, 2001) and ""Holby City"" (BBC, 1999- ). Her first big break in the UK came in 2003 when she began playing Sophie Chapman on the comedy series ""Peep Show"" (Channel 4, 2003-2015). The success of her work on ""Peep Show"" led to additional roles on British comedy shows, including ""Green Wing"" (Channel 4, 2004-07), ""Beautiful People"" (BBC Two, 2008-09), and ""Fleabag"" (BBC, 2016- ). By the early 2010s Colman also began branching out by taking on various film roles. Her film roles included ""The Iron Lady"" (2011), ""I Give It a Year"" (2013), and ""The Lobster"" (2015), the last of which was directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. In 2016 Colman won accolades in America for her recurring role on the thriller mini-series ""The Night Manager"" (BBC One/AMC, 2016). ""The Night Manager"" was broadcast on both British and American television networks, and earned Colman a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. In 2018 Colman worked with Yorgos Lanthimos once again when she was cast as Queen Anne of Britain in the period comedy-drama ""The Favourite."" The film was nominated for 10 Oscars, with Colman taking home her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2019 Colman began playing another Queen of England, Elizabeth II, on the Netflix historical drama series ""The Crown."" Colman began playing Queen Elizabeth II in the third season of the series, which premiered on the streaming network in 2019."
Rachel Weisz,"British film actress Rachel Weisz stood out from the pack of emerging U.K. thespians in the 1990s with her exotic, decidedly un-British looks, and a fierce intelligence that informed her best work. After making a name for herself as a stage and television performer of note in England, she landed her first role in a major film alongside Keanu Reeves in the thriller ""Chain Reaction"" (1996). More turns in smaller projects followed prior to her breakout performance in the action adventure ""The Mummy"" (1999), co-starring Brendan Fraser as a tomb-raiding soldier of fortune. Despite the film's financial success, later projects such as ""Beautiful Creatures"" (2001), ""About a Boy"" (2002), and ""The Shape of Things"" (2003) gave a clearer indication of her artistic leanings and fortified her growing critical reputation. Predictions of her bright future bore fruit when Weisz's stunning portrayal of an activist murdered under mysterious circumstances in the heartrending drama ""The Constant Gardner"" (2005) won her Oscar, Golden Globe, and SAG awards. She returned to screens the following year opposite Hugh Jackman in the metaphysical love story ""The Fountain"" (2006), directed by then-husband Darren Aronofsky. Undeniably deserving of her status as one of film's more intriguing and versatile actors in projects as diverse as ""The Brothers Bloom"" (2009) and ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009), Weisz continually defied expectations even as she exceeded them."
Emma Stone,
Nicholas Hoult,"British actor Nicholas Hoult seamlessly made the transition from child star into one of the top actors of his generation. A native of Workingham in England, he began acting in stage productions while still a toddler. His screen debut came at the age of five when he was cast in Philip Goodhew's ""Intimate Relations"" (1996). He began appearing regularly on television, notching guest roles on shows like ""Silent Witness"" (BBC, 1996- ) and ""Doctors"" (BBC, 2000- ). At 11, he found himself in an international hit when he played Marcus in the big screen adaptation of Nick Hornsby's novel ""About a Boy"" (2002). The film, which co-starred Hugh Grant and Toni Collette, was a critical and box office success. In his teens, he appeared as Tony Stonem in the youth drama ""Skins"" (E4,  2007-13) for two seasons. He also appeared in actor Richard E. Grant's semi-autobiographical film ""Wah-Wah"" (2005) and as Nicholas Cage's son in ""The Weather Man"" (2005). He began moving into more adult roles when he was cast in the remake of the fantasy film ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010). He gained notice throughout the film industry when he appeared as the gay college student helping Colin Firth's professor deal with the loss of his longtime companion in ""A Single Man"" (2009).  He soon found himself immersed in the blockbuster superhero genre when he signed on to play Hank McCoy (aka Beast) in ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011). Acting alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy, he would reprise the role in three subsequent films, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014), ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016), and ""Dark Phoenix"" (2019). Apart from playing the Marvel mutant hero, he starred in the fantasy adventure ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" (2013) and appeared with Charlize Theron in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015). With his blockbuster bona fides secure, he began seeking work in smaller films. He took to playing real life legends, starring as reclusive author J.D. Salinger in ""Rebel in the Rye"" (2017), inventor Nikola Tesla in ""The Current War"" (2017), and ""Lord of the Rings"" author J.R.R. Tolkien in ""Tolkien"" (2019). Teaming with Rachel Weisz (whom he had worked with as a child on ""About a Boy""), Emma Stone, and Olivia Colman, he appeared as Robert Harley, the Earl of Oxford, in the Oscar-winning period drama ""The Favourite"" (2018).  Continuing to expand his resume, he joined the cast of Taylor Sheridan's thriller ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" (2020), alongside Angelina Jolie and Tyler Perry."
Joe Alwyn,"Born and raised in London, England, actor Joe Alwyn's first role came in 2011 when he played the role of Will in ""A Higher Education,"" a short TV documentary.  Alwyn, the son of a psychotherapist and a documentary filmmaker, was a student at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama when he read for director Ang Lee. His reading landed him the title role in ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" (2016), a movie that follows a squad of soldiers who are invited to the halftime show during the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving game. The same year, Alwyn was cast in Ritesh Batra's ""The Sense of an Ending"" (2017)."
James Smith,
Sandra Bullock,"One of the top-grossing Hollywood actresses of the 1990s, ""America's sweetheart"" Sandra Bullock rose to fame with roles as the quintessential yet modern-day version of the girl-next-door: smart, capable, witty; one who triumphs in the face of impossible scenarios. Her can-do energy was at the center of her career breakout as Annie, the spunky passenger on a runaway bus in ""Speed"" (1994), after which her endearing gutsiness and charm made her a romantic comedy favorite in films like ""While You Were Sleeping"" (1995) and ""Forces of Nature"" (1999). At her peak, she was so beloved that she gave even Julia Roberts a run for her money as box office queen. To prove her versatility, Bullock regularly detoured into serious dramas like ""Infamous"" (2006) and the occasional edge-of-your seat thriller like ""Premonition"" (2007) or the intense space drama ""Gravity"" (2012). But with the exception of the Academy Award-winning ""Crash"" (2002) and her Oscar-winning turn in ""The Blind Side"" (2009), the actress attracted the most fan devotion for sparkling in comedies like ""Miss Congeniality"" (2002) and ""The Heat"" (2013), where she lit up the screen with her quirky personality and earthy, approachable beauty. Seemingly impervious to  box-office disappointments and only more respected after a scandalous failed marriage, Bullock remained one of the most commercially viable and beloved actresses in American film."
George Clooney,"After a decade spent toiling on series television, mostly in roles easily forgotten, actor George Clooney shot to stardom with his portrayal of charming but troubled pediatrician Doug Ross on the acclaimed medical series ""ER"" (NBC, 1994-2009). Thanks to his newfound celebrity, Clooney made the jump to films while still on the series, quickly establishing himself as a major Hollywood player with leading roles in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996), ""Batman & Robin"" (1997) and ""Out of Sight"" (1998). When he left the confines of the small screen for big-screen pastures, Clooney transcended mere stardom to become one of the most prominent actors of his era, emulating the devil-may-care nonchalance of a Cary Grant or Clark Gable, while at the same time becoming an Academy Award-winning performer, risk-taking director, and socially-conscious activist. While raking at the box office as the breezy Danny Ocean in ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) and its two sequels, Clooney forged ahead on a directing career with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (2002). But it was his sophomore effort behind the camera, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" (2005), that catapulted the star into the realm of top-ranking filmmakers, thanks to a number of Academy Award nominations. Meanwhile, his Oscar-winning performance as a disillusioned CIA agent in ""Syriana"" (2005), a jaded executive in ""Up in the Air"" (2009), and a widowed father in ""The Descendants"" (2011) helped put to rest any residual notions that Clooney was just a famously devout bachelor out to have a good time. Films ranging from the science fiction drama ""Gravity"" (2013) to the Coen Brothers' Old Hollywood satire ""Hail Caesar!"" (2016) to action thriller ""Money Monster"" (2016) demonstrated his ever-widening range. As he matured as both an actor and an individual (including a high-profile 2014 marriage to British-Lebanese human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin and the birth of twins in June 2017), George Clooney became one of modern Hollywood's most old-school stars."
Ed Harris,"Largely associated with stoic, hardened characters, actor Ed Harris went on to impress with a wide array of diverse performances in dozens of acclaimed films. Following a series of low-budget genre movies, Harris gained notoriety with his turn as legendary astronaut John Glenn in ""The Right Stuff"" (1983). Despite the accolades, it took several years before the actor landed another memorable role, which finally came when he was cast in James Cameron's ambitious undersea adventure ""The Abyss"" (1989). Reaping the rewards of his new A-list status, Harris vacillated between literary character work in such acclaimed endeavors as ""Glengarry Glenn Ross"" (1992) and rousing crowd-pleasers like the NASA docudrama ""Apollo 13"" (1995). The versatile actor proved just as at home with pyrotechnic blockbusters like Michael Bay's actioner ""The Rock"" (1996) as he was in more heady material, such as the Jim Carrey vehicle ""The Truman Show"" (1998). Harris later astounded audiences as both the director and star of the enthralling biopic ""Pollock"" (2000), which he followed with equally heralded supporting work in the dramas ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001) and ""The Hours"" (2002). Incredibly dexterous, he played wildly divergent characters in the small town drama ""Empire Falls"" (HBO, 2005) and the shocking ""A History of Violence"" (2005). He returned to the director's chair once more to helm the sweeping western ""Appaloosa"" (2008), cementing his reputation as a deft cinematic storyteller. One of the finest American actors of his generation, Harris' artistic reputation and professional résumé knew few equals."
Orto Ignatiussen,
Phaldut Sharma,
Amy Warren,"Amy Warren rose to fame as an actress, gracing the silver screen many times over the course of her Hollywood career.    Warren worked on a variety of projects during her early entertainment career, including ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010) and ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998). She then acted in ""The Good Wife""  (CBS, 2009-2016) and ""Boardwalk Empire""  (HBO, 2010-14). More recently, Warren acted in the Greta Gerwig comedic drama ""Mistress America""  (2015)."
Leonardo DiCaprio,
Brad Pitt,"Born in Oklahoma and raised in Missouri, Brad Pitt viewed Hollywood from afar in his youth. As he came of age, he attended the University of Missouri, but just shy of graduation, he left, setting sail for California so he could try his hand at becoming an actor in the mid-1980s. His early work was mostly uncredited, with appearances in ""Less Than Zero"" (1987) and an episode of ""21 Jump Street"" (Fox 1987-1991). His first leading film role was in ""The Dark Side of the Sun"" (1988), but the film was barely seen. That was followed up by a starring role on the show ""Glory Days"" (Fox 1990), but that only lasted six episodes. Pitt's first notable role arrived in Ridley Scott's ""Thelma & Louise"" (1991), which led to another scene-stealing turn a few years later in the Quentin Tarantino-written ""True Romance"" (1993). Nearly a decade after leaving college to go to California, Pitt broke through in 1994, where he starred in ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1994) and ""Legends of the Fall"" (1994). He followed that up in the next few years with memorable performances in David Fincher's ""Seven"" (1995) and Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys"" (1995), the latter of which led to his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. That good run of acclaim hit a speed bump after Pitt starred in a pair of commercial and critical disappointments in ""Seven Years in Tibet"" (1997) and ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998). He wasn't down for long, though, as he reunited with David Fincher for his critically acclaimed turn as Tyler Durden in ""Fight Club"" (1999). Around that time is when Pitt met Jennifer Aniston. The two married in 2000 and Pitt even earned an Emmy nomination for a guest role alongside Aniston on ""Friends"" (NBC 1994-2004). At the start of the new millennium, he starred in a number of films, including Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) and ""Ocean's Twelve"" (2004), the Greek epic ""Troy"" (2004), and ""Mr & Mrs. Smith"" (2005). He starred opposite Angelina Jolie in ""Mr & Mrs. Smith"" and that's where their relationship blossomed following Pitt's divorce with Aniston. The pair did not marry until 2014, though they were together in 2005 as Pitt adopted Jolie's children and the two started having their own kids. In 2007, Pitt began a run of acting roles that led to more Oscar buzz and acclaim, starting with ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007) and and leading to his Best Actor-nominated performance in Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008). A few years later, Pitt notched another Best Actor nomination for his performance as Billy Beane in the baseball-inspired ""Moneyball"" (2011). He even earned a credit for the Best Picture nomination ""Moneyball"" received as he was a producer on the movie. Two years later, Pitt would win a Best Picture award for producing ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). While winning awards for behind the scenes work, he still kept up as a box office star with ""World War Z"" (2013). In 2016, Pitt and Jolie separated, coinciding with a stretch where Pitt appeared in more cameos than starring roles. 2019 was a big return, though, as Pitt starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" (2019) and the space drama ""Ad Astra"" (2019)."
Margot Robbie,"Beauty was always one of Margot Robbie's assets. Born with crystal blue eyes and model good looks, the Australian-born actress rose to prominence with roles that highlighted her physical beauty, such as Donna Freedman in the long-running soap opera ""Neighbors"" (Seven Network 1985, Network Ten 1986-2010, Eleven 2011- ) and sexually tantalizing trophy wife Naomi Lapaglia in Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013), before breaking through as the near-psychotic Harley Quinn in the DC Comics blockbuster ""Suicide Squad"" (2016). Robbie was born on July 2, 1990 in the Gold Coast of Australia, where she spent much of her childhood at her grandparents' farm. After graduating from Somerset College in 2007, she began pursuing her acting career. Her first big break came when she starred in two Australian features, ""Vigilante"" (2008) and ""I.C.U."" (2009). Robbie then used the opportunity to audition for one of Australia's biggest soap operas, ""Neighbors."" Despite having thought she auditioned poorly, the show nevertheless wanted her to jump in for a guest character, an obsessed fan of Ty Harper (Dean Geyer) named Donna Freedman. However, she proved to be a terrific fit for the show and turned her character into a show regular. Robbie's startling physical beauty launched her into stardom in Australia, and she was nominated twice for a Logie Award for her performance as Donna Freedman. From 2008 to 2011, Robbie was a fan favorite on the show and ultimately left the show to pursue her dreams of Hollywood. Her first step of conquering Tinseltown came in 2011, when she was cast in the early '60s period piece drama ""Pan Am"" (ABC 2011-12). Robbie joined the show as part of an all-female lead cast who portrayed stewardesses of the iconic airline. Despite heavy promotion from ABC, the show was cancelled after just one season. However, she gained tremendous exposure for her next big project, ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio as real-life stock swindler Jordan Belfort. Robbie played Belfort's wife Naomi Lapaglia. She followed that well-received film with starring roles in science fiction thriller ""Z for Zacariah"" (2015) and twisty con-artist romantic comedy ""Focus"" (2015), opposite Will Smith. After small roles in World War II romance ""Suite Française"" (2015) and Adam McKay's real estate drama ""The Big Short"" (2015), Robbie reteamed with ""Focus"" directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, co-starring opposite Tina Fey in war zone comedy-drama ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (2016). The same year, Robbie starred in a pair of highly anticipated summer blockbusters, portraying Jane Porter in ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (2016) and psychotic antihero Harley Quinn in DC Comics thrill ride ""Suicide Squad"" (2016). The latter proved to be her mainstream breakthrough, as her showy role as the one-time psychologist turned girlfriend/victim of The Joker proved the film's most compelling performance. Robbie celebrated her mainstream breakthrough by hosting the 42nd season premiere of ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ) in October 2016."
Kurt Russell,"After getting his start as a child star in several movies for Walt Disney Studios, actor Kurt Russell managed to shed his wholesome image to play some of cinema's most notorious and hard-edged tough guys. Russell first broke the Disney mold with an acclaimed portrayal of the King in the made-for-television biopic, ""Elvis"" (ABC, 1979), which many hailed as one of the finest performances of his career. Having partnered with director John Carpenter, he next essayed one of his most enduring characters, Snake Plissken, the antihero of Carpenter's cult classic ""Escape from New York"" (1981). Russell delivered another solid performance as memorable hard-case R.J. MacReady in Carpenter's gory remake of ""The Thing"" (1982). While making the troubled romantic comedy ""Swing Shift"" (1984), Russell became romantically involved with co-star Goldie Hawn, with whom he forged a lasting partnership that resembled a marriage, but without the actual legal certificate. He was even considered by Hawn's two children from a previous marriage, actors Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson, to be - at least in spirit - their father. Meanwhile, Russell thrived throughout the 1980s with ""Big Trouble in Little China"" (1986) and ""Tequila Sunrise"" (1988), which carried over into the next decade with ""Backdraft"" (1991), ""Captain Ron"" (1992) and a dead-on portrayal of Wyatt Earp in ""Tombstone"" (1993). Following box office success with ""Stargate"" (1994) and ""Executive Decision"" (1996), Russell offered up varied performances in films like the tense thriller ""Breakdown"" (1997), Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001), hockey drama ""Miracle"" (2004), and Quentin Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"" (2007) and ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015). Whether playing the hero or the heel, Russell remained one of the most engaging actors in Hollywood."
Dakota Fanning,"Actress Dakota Fanning was born Hannah Dakota Fanning in Conyers, Georgia. Her father was a former minor league baseball player and her mother a former tennis professional. Fanning began her acting career in small local productions at the Towne Lake Arts Center in Woodstock, Georgia, a town near where she lived with her family. Her first professional acting role came in 1999 when she appeared on the long-running NBC hospital drama ""ER"" (NBC, 1994-2009). Fanning and her sister, actress Elle Fanning were raised in the Southern Baptist religion. In 2001 Fanning who had done small roles in a number of television series was cast opposite actor Sean Penn in the movie ""I Am Sam."" Her role was as the daughter of a developmentally challenged adult man who is fighting to have sole custody of his child. Her performance received a great deal of praise. In addition to her live action work, Fanning has done a number of voice-over roles in animated productions, including an English language release of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (2004), and ""Family Guy"" (Fox, 1999- ). In 2006 Fanning appeared in ""Hounddog,"" a dark movie that featured a scene in which Fanning's character was raped. The controversial film was poorly received, though Fanning's performance was praised. That same year Fanning was named the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences youngest member.  In 2010 Fanning starred in the movie ""The Runaways"" as Cherie Currie, the lead singer of the band. In July 2016 it was announced that Fanning would play the lead in the film adaptation of Sylvia Plath's novel ""The Bell Jar."" In 2019 Fanning appeared in the role of Squeaky Fromme in Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood."""
Damon Herriman,"Damon Herriman launched his acting career at the tender age of 15. Herriman's early roles were in comedies like ""The Big Steal""  (1990) with Ben Mendelsohn and Steve Bisley, ""Ned""  (2003) with Abe Forsythe and Felix Williamson and ""Son of the Mask""  (2005) with Jamie Kennedy and Alan Cumming. He also was featured in the miniseries ""Taurus Rising""  (1985-86). Herriman worked in television around the start of his acting career with a role on ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation""  (CBS, 2000-2015). He kept working in film throughout the early 2000s, starring in the dramatic adaptation ""Candy""  (2006) with Heath Ledger, the action picture ""Redbelt""  (2008) with Chiwetel Ejiofor and the Joel Edgerton thriller ""The Square""  (2009). He also appeared in the crime drama ""Fragments""  (2009) with Forest Whitaker. In his more recent career, he tackled roles in ""100 Bloody Acres""  (2013), the action film ""The Lone Ranger""  (2013) with Johnny Depp and ""Son of a Gun""  (2015). He also appeared in ""The Little Death""  (2015) with Josh Lawson. Herriman most recently acted in the Russell Crowe dramatic period piece ""The Water Diviner""  (2015)."
Casey Affleck,"While still in his twenties, the likeable and low-key Casey Affleck enjoyed a slow and steady rise as an actor as he saw the show business mechanics from the inside out while watching his older brother Ben Affleck gain meteoric Hollywood success - as well as the inevitable and subsequently vicious backlash. Still, the younger Affleck saw himself on another path, eschewing studio-produced Frankenstein projects in favor of eclectic character parts. The promise of his early work in ""To Die For"" (1995) and ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) did eventually lead him to the blockbuster types like ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) and its star-packed sequels. While nestled comfortably into one of Hollywood's most entertaining ensembles, Affleck still found a way to comfortably transform in a variety of projects, creating a witty, quirky onscreen persona along the way. How ironic then, that it was his superstar brother who, despite potential cries of nepotism, cast Affleck in the moody, haunting thriller that was Ben's directorial debut, ""Gone, Baby, Gone"" (2007) - making critics and audiences see his little brother as a real leading man in his own right at long last. However, even an Oscar-nominated turn in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007) didn't cause Affeck to change his idiosyncratic career path: he next directed a quirky mockumentary, ""I'm Still Here"" (2010), co-written by longtime friend Joaquin Phoenix and starring Phoenix as a fictionalized version of himself on a bizarre farewell tour to his life as an actor. Supporting roles in hits like animated comedy ""ParaNorman"" (2012) and Christopher Nolan's science fiction fantasy ""Interstellar"" (2014) kept Affleck in the public eye until his breakthrough performance in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea"" won him the Academy award for Best Actor and made him a mainstream film star at last. However, his next project ""A Ghost Story"" (2017) made it clear that Affleck was sticking to his idiosyncratic indie roots."
Michelle Williams,"After enjoying initial stardom on the angst-fueled teen series ""Dawson's Creek"" (The WB, 1998-2003), Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning actress Michelle Williams essayed complex, multi-faceted women in such critical and popular hits as ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), ""Blue Valentine"" (2010), ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016) and ""Fosse/Verdon"" (FX, 2019). Born Michelle Ingrid Williams in Kalispell, Montana on September 9, 1980, she relocated with her younger sister and three paternal half-siblings to San Diego, California when she was nine years of age. There, she became interested in acting after seeing a stage version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and began appearing in local theater productions. In her teenaged years, Williams began traveling to Los Angeles to audition for film and television roles, and made her screen debut as a seductive teenager in a 1993 episode of ""Baywatch"" (NBC/syndicated, 1989-2001). Appearances in features like ""Lassie"" (1994) and ""Species"" (1995) preceded her breakout role on ""Dawson's Creek."" Williams played Jen Lindley, the most visibly troubled member of the series' quartet of self-analyzing teens; though a ratings hit and a launching board for Williams's appearances in teen-oriented features like ""Halloween: H20"" (1998) and ""Dick"" (1999), she longed for more substantive work, and found it between seasons in the Off-Broadway production of Tracy Letts's Killer Joe and the HBO feature ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" (2000), which cast her and Chloe Sevigny as young gay women in a relationship. When ""Creek"" ended in 2003, Williams continued to seek out challenging fare: she was a young woman embroiled in a destructive relationship with friend Anna Friel in ""Me Without You"" (2001), and a small-town librarian involved with reclusive Peter Dinklage in ""The Station Agent"" (2003) before scoring a personal and professional triumph with Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005). Cast as Heath Ledger's long-suffering wife, she earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, while also forging a romantic relationship with Ledger that resulted in the birth of a daughter in 2005. Their union ran aground in 2007, one year before Ledger's tragic death from a prescription overdose; Williams found solace in her work, which included Todd Haynes's film about Bob Dylan, ""I'm Not There"" (2007) and Charlie Kaufman's unique ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008), as well as a near-solo turn as a homeless woman in ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008). She capped this string of indies with a potent turn as a woman who committed infanticide in Martin Scorsese's supernatural thriller ""Shutter Island"" (2010) and as a woman in a troubled marriage to Ryan Gosling in Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine"" (2010), the latter of which earned her a second Oscar nomination. A third Academy nod would come the following year with her turn as Marilyn Monroe in ""My Week with Marilyn"" (2011), which Williams followed with a diverse collection of projects, from Sarah Polley's mature romance ""Take This Waltz"" (2011) to Sam Raimi's ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" (2012), which cast her as Glinda the Good Witch. The latter was chosen to appeal to her daughter, Mathilde Rose, and Williams' desire to provide a more constant presence in her life led to stage work that culminated in a 2014 Broadway run as Sally Bowles in Cabaret and a 2016 Tony nomination for Blackbird. She returned to films in 2016 as Casey Affleck's estranged wife in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea,"" which netted a fourth Oscar nomination. Its critical success spurred a flurry of activity by Williams, who moved swiftly from the lavish musical ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017) to Ridley Scott's troubled drama ""All the Money in the World"" (2018), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination as the mother of kidnapping victim J. Paul Getty. A rare foray into big-budget genre films came with ""Venom"" (2018), an adaptation of the Marvel Comics series with Tom Hardy, provided her with the highest-grossing film of her career, which she followed with an English-language remake of ""After the Wedding"" (2019). Williams then returned to television for the first time since ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" for ""Fosse/Verdon,"" a miniseries based on the tumultuous lives and careers of choreographer and filmmaker Bob Fosse (played by Sam Rockwell) and dancer Gwen Verdon. As Verdon, Williams won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series. While filming, Williams began dating director Thomas Kail;it was announced in December 2019 that the couple had gotten engaged and that Williams was pregnant with her second child."
Kyle Chandler,"Kyle Chandler was an Emmy-winning American film and TV actor who was best known for his role as coach Eric Taylor on the critically acclaimed high school football drama ""Friday Night Lights"" (NBC/The 101 Network, 2006-2011). Born in Buffalo, New York and raised in both suburban Illinois and rural Georgia, Chandler loved playing football as a kid. When his family left Lake Forest, Illinois when he was 11, and moved to a farm in Loganville, Georgia. It was while living in Georgia that Chandler started playing organized football. He went on to play for his high school team at George Walton Academy in Monroe, Georgia for two seasons. Despite that team winning the state championship in 1979, Chandler abruptly quit during his sophomore year to pursue his growing interest in the theater. Chandler participated in his high school theater program, and when it was time to enter college, he enrolled in the drama program at the University of Georgia. Chandler got a rush out of appearing on stage and quickly devoted himself to learning everything he needed to know about acting. Then, during his senior year, with only 7 credits short of earning his bachelor's degree in drama, Chandler dropped out to accept a TV contract with ABC. As part of his contract, which focused on grooming new talent for the network, Chandler began appearing in small parts in made-for-TV movies like ""Unconquered"" (1989) and ""Home Fires Burning"" (1989). His first big break came in 1990 when he joined the cast of the Vietnam War-themed drama series ""Tour of Duty"" (CBS, 1987-1990). Chandler appeared on 8 episodes of the series during its final season in 1990. From there he went on to nab roles in films like ""The Color of Evening"" (1990) and ""Pure Country"" (1992), and was also a cast member on the ABC's period drama ""Homefront"" (ABC, 1991-93). From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s Chandler appeared almost exclusively on TV. During this period he was a castmember on ""Early Edition"" (CBS, 1996-2000), ""What About Joan?"" (ABC, 2001), and ""The Lyon's Den"" (NBC, 2003). In 2006 Chandler was nominated for an Emmy for his guest starring role on ABC's medical drama ""Grey's Anatomy"" (ABC, 2005- ). 2006 was also the year that Chandler got the break of a lifetime when he joined the cast of ""Friday Night Lights"" as Coach Eric Taylor. The series, which was based on a 2004 film of the same name, received overwhelmingly positive praise throughout its 5 season run, with some critics going on to call it one of the greatest television shows of all time. For his work on the series, Chandler took home his first Emmy Award. After ""Friday Night Lights"" ended in 2011, Chandler went on to appear in supporting roles in a number of Oscar-nominated films, most notably ""Argo"" (2012), ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013), ""Carol"" (2015), and ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016). In 2015 Chandler returned to TV with a starring turn on the Netflix thriller ""Bloodline"" (Netflix, 2015-17), which earned him two more Emmy nominations. In 2019, with over 30 years of acting experience under his belt, Chandler appeared on the Hulu mini-series ""Catch-22"" (Hulu, 2019), which was based on the acclaimed novel of the same name. 2019 was also the year Chandler played the role of Dr. Mark Russell in the blockbuster monster film ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters."" Chandler went on to reprise his role as Dr. Mark Russell in the 2020 sequel ""Godzilla v. Kong."""
Lucas Hedges,"Born in Brooklyn Heights, actor Lucas Hedges was the son of Oscar-nominated screenwriter and director Peter Hedges and his wife, Susan Bruce, a poet. Hedges graduated from St. Ann's School in Brooklyn, and later enrolled at University of North Carolina School of the Arts. Hedges' film debut came in 2007 when he appeared in his father's movie, the Steve Carell vehicle ""Dan in Real Life."" Hedges also appeared in Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012), Dante Ariola's ""Arthur Newman"" (2012), Jason Reitman's ""Labor Day"" (2013), and ""The Zero Theorem"" directed by Terry Gilliam. Hedges next appeared in another one of Wes Anderson's films, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014). His breakthrough role came when Hedges appeared in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester-by-the-Sea"" (2016). Playing the nephew of a broken, emotionally crippled man, Hedges was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2017 it was announced that Hedges would appear in ""Lady Bird,"" directed by Greta Gerwig. The same year Hedges made his debut on the stage, in an off-Broadway production of ""Yen,"" written by Anna Jordan and directed by Trip Cullman."
C.J. Wilson,
Heather Burns,"Born and raised in Chicago, actress Heather Burns is best known for her comedic work, both on television and in film. Burns attended graduate school for acting in New York City, and snagged a supporting role in in the 1998 romantic comedy ""You've Got Mail,"" starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. She was later featured in the independent film ""You Are Here*,"" along with her longtime boyfriend, Ajay Naidu. In 2000, Burns appeared as beauty contestant Cheryl Frasier in the popular Sandra Bullock comedy ""Miss Congeniality,"" and reprised the role in the 2005 sequel, ""Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous."" Among other feature comedies to showcase Burns in a supporting part are ""Two Weeks Notice,"" again starring Bullock, and ""Bewitched,"" the Hollywood remake of the fantastical sitcom. She also kept busy on television, appearing in a recurring role on the financial drama series ""The Street"" and later starring in the short-lived sitcom ""Twenty Good Years"" with John Lithgow and Jeffrey Tambor. Continuing to gravitate towards comedies, Burns had a supporting turn in the feature romance ""What's Your Number?,"" and regularly appeared on the HBO series ""Bored to Death"" as Leah, the sometimes-girlfriend of troubled comic-book artist Ray, played by Zach Galifianakis."
Ellar Coltrane,"As a child actor, Ellar Coltrane became part of a unique filmmaking experiment where he was filmed in short bursts throughout a twelve-year period, culminating in the acclaimed film ""Boyhood"" (2014), directed by Richard Linklater. Ellar Coltrane was born Ellar Coltrane Kinney Salmon in August 27, 1994, and grew up in Linklater's home state of Austin, Texas. Coltrane was chosen from a long list of potential candidates for ""Boyhood,"" and was cast when he was six years old. Linklater also cast Coltrane in a small role in his film ""Fast Food Nation"" (2006) while ""Boyhood"" was still in production. ""Boyhood"" told the story of a child's growing up, raised by his parents, played by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, after their divorce. The filming of ""Boyhood"" took place for several weeks every year for over a decade, but the ultimate shooting schedule over all this time was thirty-nine days. Linklater wrote the script as he went, basing the story on Coltrane's real life development from childhood into young adulthood. The goal was to make a film that worked like time-lapse photography, done more realistically than having Coltrane age through CGI or motion capture special effects. Once all the footage was finally assembled into the finished film, ""Boyhood"" was a critical hit, and won a number of festival awards as well."
Patricia Arquette,"It can certainly be said that Patricia Arquette hails from a show business family. Of the actor's four siblings, three of them-David, Rosanna, and Alexis Arquette-were actors as well. Arquette was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1968 to Brenda and Lewis Arquette, the latter of whom was also an actor. The family moved from Chicago to a commune in Virginia for a period of time before returning to Chicago and then eventually, settling in Los Angeles. Arquette took an interest in acting at a young age, though she entertained interests in becoming a midwife or even a nun. Her home life could be extremely unstable and often violent, and so at age 14, Arquette ran away and began living with her older sister Rosanna, who was already a working actor. Arquette made her screen debut in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" (1987). Parts followed in projects like the Sam Shepard ensemble film ""Far North"" (1988) and the gritty drama ""The Indian Runner"" (1991) before she landed the role of Alabama in ""True Romance"" (1993), a quirky crime drama written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The movie became a sleeper sensation and Arquette became an in-demand actor, quickly moving on to star in the adventure drama ""Beyond Rangoon"" (1995) in 1995, the same year she married fellow actor Nicolas Cage-though it was revealed later that the couple separated after less than a year before eventually divorcing in 2000. Arquette continued to appear in prestige projects such as David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" (1997) and Martin Scorsese's ""Bringing Out the Dead"" (1999). Then in 2005, Arquette began starring on the hit TV series ""Medium"" (NBC, 2005-2011) beginning a new phase in her fame. She married actor Thomas Jane the following year, and though their marriage ended the same year that ""Medium"" wrapped in 2011, Arquette was soon impressing audiences once again as she joined the cast of the acclaimed period crime series ""Boardwalk Empire"" (HBO, 2010-2014) in 2013. The next year saw the release of a project Arquette had been working on for several years, the real-time coming-of-age film ""Boyhood"" (2014), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She moved on to star on ""CSI: Cyber"" (CBS, 2015-2016) before earning tremendous acclaim portraying disturbed mother Dee Dee Blanchard in the limited series ""The Act"" (Hulu, 2019-2019), based on the true story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard."
Ethan Hawke,"Even though he exhibited star-making potential in films like ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989) and ""Reality Bites"" (1994), actor Ethan Hawke chose instead to be something of a Gen-X Renaissance Man, starring in offbeat movies, publishing modestly-acclaimed novels, directing artsy independent films and even forming his own Manhattan-based theater company. Though he did make occasional forays into pricey studio films like ""Gattaca"" (1997), ""Great Expectations"" (1998) and ""Training Day"" (2001), Hawke was more at home pursuing his artistic ambitions for art's sake, not for large pay days or widespread recognition. Perhaps nowhere was this more apparent than his several collaborations with director Richard Linklater, with whom the actor most notably starred in ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), ""Waking Life"" (2001), ""Before Sunset"" (2004), ""Before Midnight"" (2013) and ""Boyhood"" (2014), which the actor and director had shot in pieces over the course of 12 years. Elsewhere, his films ranged from the commercially successful horror effort ""The Purge"" (2013) to more personal films like a biopic of troubled jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, ""Born to Be Blue"" (2015). Hawke did suffer the fate of most celebrities by landing in the tabloids for his widely publicized divorce with actress Uma Thurman after rumors of infidelity, but he continued to chart his own course on both stage and screen, making Hawke one of the more intriguing and unpredictable actors of his generation."
Lorelei Linklater,
Tamara Jolaine,
Nick Krause,
Brie Larson,"A striking young actress gifted well beyond her years, Brie Larson cut her professional teeth with television roles on shows like ""Raising Dad"" (The WB, 2001-02) and ""Right on Track"" (Disney Channel, 2003) and scored tween-friendly hits by appearing in the feature films ""13 Going on 30"" (2004), ""Sleepover"" (2004) and ""Hoot"" (2006). She made the transition from child star to grown-up actress smoothly, earning acclaim for her turns in such movies as ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (2010) and ""21 Jump Street"" (2012) and impressed critics with her nuanced turn as Toni Collette's self-destructive daughter on ""The United States of Tara"" (Showtime, 2009-2011). Critics dubbed her the ""It"" girl of SXSW 2013 for her flurry of high-profile projects, particularly her raved-about, star-making lead role in the drama ""Short Term 12"" (2013), which earned her serious award buzz. Two years later, she exceeded those expectations with a subtle performance in the indie drama ""Room"" (2015), which garnered widespread critical acclaim and a Best Actress Oscar. One of the rare talents who only improved with age, Brie Larson gave critics and fans ample reason to expect her to reach even greater artistic heights over time, even as she also tackled roles in escapist fare like ""Kong: Skull island"" (2017) and joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as superhero Carol Danvers in ""Captain Marvel"" (2019)."
Samuel L. Jackson,"Although starting out with small roles and trouble with the law, Samuel L. Jackson has since become a highly sought after actor and film producer.  Born in Washington, D.C.,he was a student activist at Morehouse College and served as an usher at the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His protests led to his being arrested and convicted of unlawful confinement. After finishing college, he moved to New York where his early stage and television career was stunted by substance abuse issues. After a number of small parts on television in the early '80s, Jackson's career finally began to find true traction thanks to his relationship with Spike Lee. The director cast him in parts in ""School Daze"" (1988),""Do the Right Thing"" (1989), and ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990). Along with small, but memorable roles, in ""Coming to America"" (1988) and Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (1990), his profile in the industry began increasing. His true breakout came due to another collaboration with Lee. After having just completed a rehabilitation program for cocaine and heroin addiction, Jackson garnered critical raves as the drug-addicted brother of Wesley Snipes' architect in ""Jungle Fever"" (1991). His film roles increased steadily, including parts in Steven Spielberg's blockbuster ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and opposite Harrison Ford in the thriller ""Patriot Games"" (1992). It was a relationship with another director, however, that put the actor on the map for good. Having worked with Quentin Tarantino on ""True Romance"" (1993), he was cast in the filmmaker's seminal ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). Playing the Scripture-quoting hitman Jules, alongside John Travolta, the actor was swept up in a pop culture phenomenon. From then on, Jackson became an in-demand film actor. His high profile roles included joining Bruce Willis for ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) and reteaming with Tarantino for ""Jackie Brown"" (1997). He also joined sci-fi lore by playing Jedi Master Mace Windu in George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" prequels, ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999), ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002), and ""Revenge of the Sith"" (2005). M. Night Shyamalan paired the actor once again with Willis for the supernatural thriller ""Unbreakable"" (2000) - a film that would eventually get a sequel 19 years later starring the pair again in ""Glass"" (2019). He later became one of the mainstays of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury. Beginning in ""Iron Man"" (2008) and continuing through the international blockbusters of ""The Avengers"" (2012) series and appearing as a younger version of the character in ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), Jackson played the hero to the point of becoming synonymous with the character. The actor continued his relationship with Tarantino as well, appearing in the director's ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015). Jackson's standing as an action star continued deep into his career as well, playing John Shaft in both ""Shaft"" (2000) and the sequel ""Shaft"" (2019), and teaming with Ryan Reynolds for ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" (2017) and ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" (2020)."
Ben Mendelsohn,"Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn may have missed out on the first wave of Aussies to invade Hollywood in the '90s, but his standout role in 2010's crime drama ""Animal Kingdom"" marked the beginning of a new chapter in his long career. A fixture on '80s Down Under shows such as ""Neighbours"" (Seven Network, 1985- ), Mendelsohn landed a breakout role as a loud-mouthed rugby player in the 1987 critically-acclaimed film ""The Year My Voice Broke."" Though he continued working steadily in both Australia and the U.S., most notably appearing opposite Anthony Hopkins in ""The Efficiency Expert"" (1992), Mendelsohn languished in minor projects until being cast in the high-profile films ""The New World"" (2005) and ""Australia"" (2008). Then came ""Animal Kingdom,"" which led to even bigger roles in the gritty ""Killing Them Softly"" (2012); the blockbuster ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012); and the indie success ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2013), and finally the massively successful ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" (2016). Finally, Hollywood had caught up to the talented actor from Oz."
Djimon Hounsou,"Model-turned-actor Djimon Hounsou was seemingly plucked from obscurity by producer Debbie Allen and director Steven Spielberg in 1997 to portray Joseph Cinque, the leader of a slave ship mutiny, in ""Amistad."" His critically acclaimed performance led to supporting roles alongside Hollywood A-listers in historic dramas like ""Gladiator"" (2000) and the African-set adventure ""Blood Diamond"" (2006), which earned the actor significant awards and nominations. Unsurprisingly, Hounsou's towering frame and expressive features were tapped for a number of forgettable good vs. evil actioners, but he made the strongest mark in character-driven dramas like ""In America"" (2002) and Julie Taymor's ""The Tempest"" (2009), where he revealed the uncommon sensitivity and emotional range behind the powerful, commanding presence."
Lee Pace,"Born Lee Grinner Pace on March 25, 1979 in Chickasha, Oklahoma, he was the eldest of three children by oil company engineer James Roy Pace and his schoolteacher wife, Charlotte. His father's profession required Pace to relocate numerous times throughout his childhood, and he spent several years in the Middle East before the family settled in Houston, Texas. There, Pace began performing with the city's esteemed Alley Theater while still a student at Klein High School, and briefly dropped out to appear more frequently in productions. After completing his school requirements in 1997, Pace was accepted to the Jullliard School's Drama Division, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. From there, he landed roles in Off-Broadway plays before making his television debut in a 2002 episode of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" (NBC, 1999- ). The following year, Pace earned his breakout role as a transgender woman who becomes romantically involved with an Army private in the award-winning drama ""Soldier's Girl"" (Showtime 2003). The role, which required Pace to don considerable prosthetic makeup while also navigating the complex relationship between his character, a real-life transgender cabaret performer, and the soldier who was murdered by his fellow soldiers for his sexual orientation. Pace received critical acclaim for his performance, as well as Golden Globe and Satellite Award nominations. He then segued to series regular work on ""Wonderfalls"" (Fox 2012), producer Bryan Fuller's eclectic fantasy-drama, which became a critical favorite but an immediate casualty due to low ratings. He then segued into a series of high-profile feature projects, including the James Ivory-directed ""White Countess"" (2005) and Douglas McGrath's ""Infamous"" (2006), which cast him as the doomed murderer Dick Hickok, whose crimes served as the basis for Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. Pace reunited with Fuller for another low-rated cult favorite fantasy, ""Pushing Daisies"" (ABC 2007-09), in which he played the lead role of Ned, a baker who learns he has the ability to bring the dead back to life. He returned to TV with ""Halt and Catch Fire"" (AMC 2014- ), a dramatic period piece about the rise of the personal computing industry."
Lashana Lynch,"American audiences were first introduced to actor Lashana Lynch when she took on the leading role of Rosaline on the Shonda Rhimes-produced period series ""Still Star-Crossed"" (ABC, 2017-). Born in London, England, Lynch was largely raised by her grandmother, who immigrated to the U.K. from Jamaica. Lynch's love of singing found her writing her own songs by the time she was 12, and later becoming a finalist in England's ""Urban Voice"" and ""UK Unsigned"" competitions. Meanwhile, Lynch's burgeoning love of acting motivated her to attend London's Arts Educational Schools. After graduating in 2010, she began appearing in plays and eventually landed her first film role, playing an Olympic athlete in ""Fast Girls"" (2012). The role required her to train for four hours a day, five days a week, but Lynch was excited to meet the challenge. She next appeared in ""Powder Room"" (2013) the following year, before starring in a production of ""Educating Rita"" at the Minerva Theatre in Chichester. Lynch then landed a starring role on the series ""Crims"" (BBC, 2015) which unfortunately only ran for six episodes. Another break came in 2016 when she was cast as Ashanti in the crime drama ""Brotherhood"" (2016), shortly before being cast in the starring role on mega-hit writer and producer Shonda Rhimes' first period series, ""Still Star-Crossed."""
Paul Rudd,"Armed with effortless charm and a disarming smile, actor Paul Rudd made his name on stage and screen in a number of notable projects, as well as cultivating an avid following as both a sensitive leading man and as a comic foil. While he became vaguely recognizable thanks to several prominent film and television roles - namely as Alicia Silverstone's know-it-all stepbrother in ""Clueless"" (1995), Phoebe's husband on ""Friends"" (NBC, 1994-2004), and Jennifer Aniston's gay best friend in the romantic comedy ""The Object of My Affection"" (1998) - Rudd eventually rode the Judd Apatow wave to stardom with a series of surprisingly successful comedies in which he was more often than not, the primary scene-stealer. His roles in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005), ""Knocked Up"" (2007), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008), ""Role Models"" (2008) and ""I Love You, Man"" (2009) established the versatile actor, who oscillated easily between comedy and drama both on screen and on stage, as a bona fide box-office force and a rising star. Because of his raised profile, Rudd was able to take bigger risks in less mainstream projects, as he did for ""Dinner for Schmucks"" (2010) and ""Our Idiot Brother"" (2011). He took a step back with a leading role in James L. Brooks' critically maligned romantic comedy ""How Do You Know"" (2010) and stepped into a producer's role for the low-budget ""Wanderlust"" (2011), and later became an unlikely superhero in the Marvel hit ""Ant-Man"" (2015). But regardless of his projects' success or lack thereof, moviegoers held great reserves of goodwill for the actor. No matter how big or small the project, Rudd became one of Hollywood's most popular and marketable stars."
Evangeline Lilly,"Evangeline Lilly was a Canadian actress and writer who first rose to prominence by co-starring in one of the most successful TV shows of the early 21st century, before moving on to some of the biggest franchise blockbuster films of the era, but soon made it abundantly clear that she saw acting as nothing more than a means to and end, which allowed her to pursue her interests in writing and humanitarian causes. Born Nicole Evangeline Lilly on August 3, 1979 in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada, she was the middle child in a family of three daughters. Lilly's mother was a produce manager, while her father taught home economics. Later in life, Lilly would credit her interest in philanthropy and humanitarian causes to her Christian upbringing. After graduating from W.J. Mouat Secondary School in Abbotsford, British Columbia, where she played soccer and served as Vice President of the student council, Lilly went on a humanitarian aid trip to the Philippines, before enrolling at the University of British Columbia, where she majored in International Relations. She intended to use her degree to pursue a career in philanthropy, but that all changed one afternoon. While walking down the street in Kelowna, British Columbia, Lilly was approached by an agent from the Ford Modeling Agency, who gave her a business card. Eventually she contacted the agency, and soon landed a number of commercial appearances and non-speaking parts on TV shows such as ""Smallville"" (The WB, 2001-2011) and ""Kingdom Hospital"" (ABC, 2004). Though she had never had a credited speaking part, Lilly was sent to audition for a new ABC drama co-created by J.J. Abrams, knowing only that it took place on a deserted island. Out of the 75 women who auditioned for the role of Kate Austen, the leader of a group of air crash survivors who becomes ensnared in a love triangle with disgraced doctor Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and anti-social con man James ""Sawyer"" Ford (Josh Holloway), Lilly was surprised to land the role, but still through that the show, ""Lost"" (ABC, 2004-2010), would not last more than a single season. Luckily for her, she was wrong. Following its premiere on September 22, 2004, ""Lost"" was an instant cultural phenomenon, earning rave reviews from critics and drawing audiences in with its mysterious sci-fi structure, designed to keep them guessing from episode to episode just where these people were, and for that matter, who they were. Though the Kate-Jack-Sawyer love triangle was a controversial plot point amongst fans of the show, Lilly was often praised for her nuanced portrayal of Kate, even earning a Golden Globe nomination in 2006. ""Lost"" would go on to win ten Primetime Emmy Awards, including the 2005 statuette for Outstanding Drama Series, and was eventually ranked as the the top-rated TV show of the decade by IMDb. Despite all of this success, Lilly decided that she might take a break from acting for a while following the ""Lost"" finale, choosing to focus on writing, humanitarian work, and raising her two sons alongside her partner, Norman Kali. Though she would continue acting, including performances in the Oscar-winning war drama ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009) and entering the cinematic realm of Middle Earth to play the Mirkwood elf warrior Tauriel in ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013) and ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014), she made it clear that she saw acting as more of a day job than a true calling. In 2013, Lilly's debut children's book, ""The Squickerwonkers"" (2013), the first part in a proposed series, was released. She then ventured into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, taking on the role of Hope van Dyne in ""Ant-Man"" (2015), a role she would reprise for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" (2018) and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). Lilly could next be seen in ""Dreamland"" (2020), a thriller from writer/director Nicholas Jarecki set against the backdrop of the opioid crisis."
Michael Douglas,"Actor and producer Michael Douglas enjoyed great success by avoiding the heroic leading-man archetype by creating smart, flawed, sympathetically human characters. His popularity grew through several star-making hits, including ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987) and ""Basic Instinct"" (1992) and held strong as he portrayed midlife professionals at a crossroads in ""Wall Street"" (1987) and ""Wonder Boys"" (2000). Douglas rarely dominated a movie like his famous father Kirk Douglas had during his 1950s heyday, and, though his $20-million price tag might have suggested otherwise, the younger Douglas remained more of a complementary player who allowed a collection of strong actors to drive a film. In addition to his movie-star status, Douglas was well known as a film producer, garnering a Best Picture Oscar for his first outing, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975), and maintaining his reputation with films including ""The China Syndrome"" (1979) and ""The Rainmaker"" (1997). The respected and well-liked actor raised eyebrows, however, when he married the much-younger screen beauty Catherine Zeta-Jones, with whom he later co-starred in the drug war drama ""Traffic"" (2000). Douglas' professional output decreased at the start of the new millennium, marked by lesser efforts such as the remake of ""The In-Laws"" (2003), but it was a succession of tragic events - the fatal overdose of half-brother Eric; the conviction of son Cameron for drug dealing; and Douglas himself being diagnosed with throat cancer - that cast a pall on the venerable star's personal life. Exhibiting the strength of character he had become known for, Douglas resurrected his most famous character, Gordon Gekko, in ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" (2010), garnering critical praise and reminding the world that Douglas was still a force to be reckoned with."
Walton Goggins,"An intense method actor who spent many years struggling in supporting roles as good-natured Southerners, Walton Goggins first gained widespread attention by portraying the corrupt and erratic Detective Shane Vendrell on the gritty cop drama, ""The Shield"" (FX, 2002-08). Prior to his star-making turn on ""The Shield,"" Goggins logged numerous guest spots on television series before landing his first major film role opposite Robert Duvall in ""The Apostle"" (1997). In 2001, he won an Academy Award as one of the producers of the acclaimed short film ""The Accountant,"" which he made with fellow actors Ray McKinnon and Lisa Blount while tackling character roles in hits including ""Shanghai Noon"" (2000) and ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002). After ""The Shield"" ended, Goggins landed an even more acclaimed TV role as emotionally complex career criminal Boyd Crowder on the modern western ""Justified"" (FX, 2010-15) while co-starring in films including Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015)."
Bobby Cannavale,"A native New Yorker who managed to avoid the ethnic typecasting that limited so many other actors with similar backgrounds, Bobby Cannavale was an Emmy Award-winning actor known for procedural TV dramas as well as big screen comedy and numerous Broadway accomplishments. Some of Cannavale's best-known roles found him in uniform like FDNY paramedic Bobby Caffey on ""Third Watch"" (NBC, 1999-2005), boss of ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" (2009), and his Emmy-winning guest appearances as Will's cop boyfriend on ""Will & Grace"" (NBC, 1998-2006). But while he certainly scored as ""regular Joes"" - including his charming work in the indie favorite ""The Station Agent"" (2003) - he easily adapted into a wide range of characters and consistently enjoyed cross-medium success that few actors could match. In fact, he translated his easygoing appeal across a wide spectrum of projects like ""Snakes on a Plane"" (2005) and ""Fast Food Nation"" (2006), while also appearing steadily on stage with roles in ""Mauritius"" (2008), ""The Talk"" (2008) and ""The Motherf**ker with the Hat"" (2011). Aside from indie features and stage roles, he landed parts in major blockbusters like ""Tower Heist"" (2011) and had memorable recurring roles on critically acclaimed series like ""Boradwalk Empire"" (HBO 2010-14) and ""Nurse Jackie"" (Showtime, 2009-2015) before starring in Martin Scorsese's '70s-set record industry drama ""Vinyl"" (HBO 2016) and joining the cast of cult favorite ""Mr. Robot"" (USA 2015- ) for its third season. Whether his role was large or small, Cannavale always delivered standout performances that garnered the actor considerable attention."
Robert Downey Jr.,"Despite Oscar and Golden Globe nominations and the unshakeable respect of film critics and his acting peers, Robert Downey, Jr. insisted that he was not really an actor, just a good hustler who had found a way to make a living. If he did not believe he was acting, it was certainly reflected in his seamless skills, which were full of natural, physical expressiveness. After making himself known as the drug-addicted antihero of ""Less Than Zero"" (1987), Downey delivered an uncanny portrayal of beloved silent film star ""Chaplin"" (1992), which earned him some of the highest praise of his career. But his gift had always been to transform a regular person into a creatively-detailed and thoroughly engrossing star of the show, often complete with memorable quirks. Even in his early roles in teen comedies, Downey stood out above his Brat Pack peers for his spontaneous energy and apparent fearlessness in exposing his very fragile inner workings. Though he made headlines for his manic portrayal of a tabloid TV journalist in ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994) and a gay book editor in ""Wonder Boys"" (2000), Downey unfortunately became more famous for his longtime drug addictions and numerous run-ins with the law. He eventually emerged from almost certain tragedy by attaining sobriety and re-launching his flagging career with a blockbuster starring turn in the hit ""Iron Man"" (2008), while earning laughs as a chameleon-like actor in ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), which only confirmed that the public loved a good comeback story as well as appreciated Downey's incredibly likeable presence on the big screen. Continuing his role as Iron Man throughout the series of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including the blockbuster hit ""The Avengers"" (2012) and its sequels, Downey also starred in films ranging from ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) to familial legal drama ""The Judge"" (2014). In 2019, he would appear again as Tony Stark in ""Avengers: Endgame,"" reported to be the conclusion to the story of the original Avengers team. He also filmed a starring role in ""The Voyage of Dr. Dolittle"" (2020), and, through his banner Team Downey, was producing a remake of ""Perry Mason"" for HBO."
Chris Hemsworth,"Tall, muscular and exceptionally handsome, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth became a star in the U.S. with a series of well-received genre films. He was a household name in his native country while starring on the popular drama series, ""Home and Away"" (7 Network, 1988- ), playing an opinionated student navigating his way through high school in a seaside town. He quickly became a sci-fi sensation across the pond with a brief but memorable role in the J.J. Abrams reboot of the worldwide phenomenon ""Star Trek"" (2009) as Capt. James T. Kirk's ill-fated father. But it was not until he landed the lead role in the film version of the comic book hero ""Thor"" (2011) - beating out his younger brother, fellow heartthrob Liam, in the process - that Hemsworth truly flexed his muscles, establishing himself as one of the most charismatic young actors of the moment. Lionsgate films quickly capitalized on Hemsworth's popularity by releasing the long-delayed horror feature ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012), co-written by Joss Whedon. Ironically, it was Whedon who later directed the young star in the superhero blockbuster ""The Avengers"" (2012), bringing together ""Thor"" and Marvel Studios' other franchise films. Along with his continuing screen presence as the Nordic superhero, Hemsworth expanded with range with films ranging from the thriller ""Blackhat"" (2015), Ron Howard's sailing drama ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (2015), and two fantasy films based on fairy tales, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016). As talented as he was attractive, Hemsworth was without a doubt, a leading man to watch."
Josh Brolin,"Josh James Brolin was born on Feb. 12, 1968 in Santa Monica, CA. Despite being born to successful film actor James Brolin, Josh's upbringing in rural Templeton, CA kept him estranged from the Hollywood world. By the time he was a teenager, however, Brolin had begun his own acting career, making his screen debut with a starring role in the Richard Donner-directed and Steven Spielberg-produced adventure comedy ""The Goonies"" (1985). Notice from the role earned Brolin work in films like ""Thrashin'"" (1986) and television shows like ""The Young Riders"" (ABC 1989-1992). Following the cancelation of said series, in which Brolin starred as Wild Bill Hickok, he returned to film acting, accruing roles in ""The Road Killers"" (1994), David O. Russell's ""Flirting with Disaster"" (1996), Guillermo del Toro's ""Mimic"" (1997), and ""My Brother's War"" (1997), directed by his father James. The decade to follow paired Brolin with a number of big name directors: he appeared in Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" (2004), Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"" (2007), Joel and Ethan Coen's ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007), Gus Van Sant's ""Milk"" (2008), and Oliver Stone's ""W."" (2008), in which Brolin played President George W. Bush. He reteamed with Stone for ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" (2010) and with the Coens for ""True Grit"" (2010), and then went on to work with Spike Lee on ""Oldboy"" (2013) and Paul Thomas Anderson on ""Inherent Vice"" (2014). That same year marked Brolin's first appearance as Thanos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by way of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014); he reprised the character in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019)."
Chadwick Boseman,"A charismatic performer with an easy Everyman presence, Chadwick Boseman paid his acting dues for a full decade before taking the spotlight with his starring turn in the Jackie Robinson biopic ""42"" (2013). With strong roots in theater, Boseman made a name for himself as a stage actor, director and playwright prior to landing notable screen roles. In 2003, he began appearing on television in one-off guest spots on various procedural dramas before joining the cast of the drama ""Lincoln Heights"" (ABC Family, 2007-09) as recurring character Nate Ray Taylor. Boseman subsequently found a regular part on the mysterious thriller series ""Persons Unknown"" (NBC, 2010), but the show was quickly cancelled. A starring role in the little-seen action movie ""The Kill Hole"" (2012) followed, but Boseman bounced back from this relative disappointment with the lead in Brian Helgeland's historical baseball drama ""42,"" a film that placed him squarely on the Hollywood map. Performances as James Brown in the biopic ""Get On Up"" (2014) and in the blockbusters ""Gods of Egypt"" (2016) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) maintained his standing as one of Hollywood's hottest young actors before his title performance in the blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018) made him an international superstar. Born in South Carolina, Chadwick Boseman gravitated towards the theater in his youth, going on to attend both Howard University in Washington, D.C. and the British American Dramatic Academy in Oxford, England. Establishing himself as a notable up-and-comer in African-American-centric theater productions, a number of which he wrote and directed, Boseman eventually set his sights on screen acting. Starting out in brief guest roles on procedural dramas such as ""Third Watch"" (NBC, 1999-2005) and ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010), he finally garnered more notable parts in 2008, with a supporting role in the football movie ""The Express"" and an extended arc on the family drama ""Lincoln Heights,"" where he played a troubled young war vet. Boseman was seemingly on the verge on his big break when he was cast as the key character of another military vet, Sergeant Graham McNair, in Christopher McQuarrie's high-concept mystery series ""Persons Unknown"" (NBC, 2010). Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after 13 episodes, leaving him to return to one-off appearances on various television dramas, including fan-favorite fare such as ""Fringe"" (Fox, 2008-2013) and ""Justified"" (FX, 2010-15). Following a featured turn in the widely panned low-budget action film ""The Kill Hole"" (2012), Boseman's fortunes changed considerably. Veteran Hollywood writer/director Brian Helgeland tapped Boseman to play the main role of pioneering baseball player Jackie Robinson in the hit drama ""42,"" a production that not only led to immediate recognition for his determined performance, but also found him acting alongside film icon Harrison Ford. After playing another athlete opposite Kevin Costner in Ivan Reitman's ""Draft Day"" (2014), Boseman took on the task of portraying another influential black figure of the 20th century in the James Brown biopic ""Get On Up"" (2014). Boseman next appeared in Alex Proyas' Biblical epic ""Gods of Egypt"" and as the superhero Black Panther in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) before gearing up for starring roles as Thurgood Marshall in ""Marshall"" (2016) and in his own superhero action fest, ""Black Panther"" (2018), which was a massive critical and commercial success upon its February 2018 release. Boseman returned to the role later that year in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018). He next starred in the action thriller ""21 Bridges"" (2019) and appeared in Spike Lee's Vietnam drama ""Da 5 Bloods"" (2020).  Chadwick Boseman died at his home in Los Angeles on August 28, 2020 at the age of 43, following a four-year battle with colon cancer. His final film role was in the posthumous ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" which he completed in 2019."
Mark Ruffalo,"Like many other actors who were tagged ""best of a generation,"" Mark Ruffalo's roots were in theater and independent film where his honest, open character approach was applauded. His breakout stage role in Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed ""This Is Our Youth"" led Lonergan to give Ruffalo the lead in his film directorial debut ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000), which earned countless festival awards and had critics buzzing about the little-known actor's subtle, compelling performance as a cerebral but aimless young adult with an arrest record and a pregnant teenage girlfriend. Hollywood came courting, but struggled with a tidy niche in which to put the darkly handsome actor; first offering him small but effective character roles as ""conflicted"" types in big budget thrillers like ""Collateral"" (2004) before unsuccessfully making the understated actor into a bland leading man in romantic comedies like ""Just Like Heaven"" (2005). Ruffalo eventually found an appropriate arena somewhere between the multiplex and the art house, favored by character-driven directors like Jane Campion, David Fincher, Steven Zaillian and eventually Martin Scorsese - all of whom capitalized on the actor's talent for believably disappearing into complex, empathetic characters."
Zoe Saldana,"After spending most of her youth training as a dancer, Zoe Saldana made the transition to acting on screen after an attention-getting performance in the stage musical ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."" Saldana began landing television and feature roles almost immediately, including ""Center Stage"" (2000), in which she was able to showcase her years of ballet training. Despite the fast start, her career had trouble lifting off after a series of disappointing film like ""Get Over It"" (2001) and ""Crossroads"" (2002), though she did make fleeting appearances in large studio fare like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" (2003) and ""The Terminal"" (2004). Eventually, Saldana managed to break free from the confines of broad comedy and forgettable independents when she was cast to play both Lieutenant Uhura in the highly anticipated reboot of ""Star Trek"" (2009) and its sequels, Gamora in Marvel's action comedy smash ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), and the Na'vi heroine, Neytiri, in James Cameron's box office behemoth, ""Avatar"" (2009). These blockbusters bounced the actress from relative obscurity to undeniable movie star, but she also took the time to appear in smaller-scale prestige projects such as Luc Besson's action thriller ""Colombiana"" (2011), family drama ""Infinitely Polar Bear"" (2014), and Ben Affleck's Prohibition-set drama ""Live By Night"" (2016)."
Michael Keaton,"Though he began his career in stand-up comedy, intense actor Michael Keaton blossomed into a multi-talented performer comfortable in comedies, gritty dramas and big budget action movies. At first, he used his manic onscreen persona to great effect in early hits like ""Night Shift"" (1982) and ""Mr. Mom"" (1983); the former of which put him on the map, while the latter turned him into a star. But it was his wild turn as a perverse ghost in Tim Burton's ""Beetlejuice"" (1988) and his compelling dramatic performance as a cocaine addict trying to get his life together in ""Clean and Sober"" (1988) that showcased his true talents. Keaton reached new heights when he won the title role in Burton's take on ""Batman"" (1989). His casting surprised many - and angered some - though when the finished film was released, most were in agreement that Keaton's brooding performance was inspired. After the inevitable sequel, ""Batman Returns"" (1992), Keaton's career entered a commercial and critical downturn with films like ""Jack Frost"" (1998), or little-seen indies like ""Quicksand"" (2001) that barely saw the light of day. He emerged onto the small screen with an acclaimed turn in ""Live from Bagdad"" (HBO, 2002), a reminder that Keaton was capable of handling any role in any genre or medium. After settling into a solid career as a character actor, Keaton returned to public consciousness with a career-redefining role in the Oscar-winning ""Birdman"" (2014). Further work in another Best Picture winner, ""Spotlight"" (2015), Ray Kroc biopic ""The Founder"" (2016) and superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) proved that Michael Keaton had managed a late-career renaissance."
Marisa Tomei,"For some performers, winning an Oscar became both a blessing and a curse. While an Academy Award could lead to bigger and better roles, it could also bring about career stagnation, as the actor tried to live up to unrealistic expectations. Actress Marisa Tomei was in danger of failing to warrant the hype after seemingly coming out of nowhere to nab Best Supporting Actress for her comical performance in ""My Cousin Vinny"" (1992). Though she spent the following years in little-seen movies like ""Only You"" (1994) and ""Happy Accidents"" (2000), Tomei also delivered powerful performances in indie dramas ""Unhook the Stars"" (1996) and ""The Slums of Beverly Hills"" (1998), but they failed to propel her career due to slim box office performances. She proved her talent and career longevity, however, with her Oscar-nominated, subtle but complex turns in ""In the Bedroom"" (2001) and ""The Wrestler"" (2008), as well as strong performances in films ranging from romantic comedy ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" (2011) to barbed satire ""The Big Short"" (2015) proving her worth to critics who had cruelly deemed her win for ""My Cousin Vinny"" to be a fluke, vindicating fans and critics who recognized her considerable talents all along."
Jon Favreau,"Actor, producer, writer and director Jon Favreau hit unlikely pay dirt when ""Swingers"" (1996), his low-budget, autobiographical indie about struggling young actors, turned he and co-star/real-life best friend Vince Vaughn into hot property seemingly overnight. Favreau parlayed his rising profile into a number of supporting big-screen roles as cynical side men, but he was more anxious to get behind the camera and direct bigger features. After another indie buddy comedy with Vaughn, mob farce ""Made"" (2001), Favreau went wide with the holiday hit ""Elf"" (2003), starring a spandex-clad Will Ferrell. His acclaimed adaptation of the kids book ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) missed the mark with audiences, but his 2008 adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Iron Man"" starring Robert Downey, Jr. was one of the most anticipated action films of the year, leading to a return to leading man status for Downey, Jr. and hard-won blockbuster credentials for its highly creative director. Along with continuing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a producer and actor (playing Tony Stark's personal assistant Happy Hogan), Favreau found further success as a director through films as varied as the romantic comedy-drama ""Chef"" (2014) and the CGI blockbusters ""The Jungle Book"" (2016) and ""The Lion King"" (2019)."
Gwyneth Paltrow,"Gwyneth Kate Paltrow was born on Sept. 27, 1972 in Los Angeles, CA. Raised by Hollywood fixtures Bruce Paltrow, a successful director and producer, and renowned actress Blythe Danner, Gwyneth Paltrow was practically predestined toward a life of show business, despite a brief sojourn studying anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Paltrow made her acting debut at age 17 in the TV movie ""High"" (CBS 1989), directed by her father. The following year, Paltrow graced the stage at the Williamstown Theatre Festival, and one year later still she broke onto the big screen with the drama film ""Shout"" (1991), costarring John Travolta, and Steven Spielberg's reimagining of the Peter Pan story, ""Hook"" (1991). Before long, Paltrow was starring in hit features like David Fincher's thriller ""Se7en"" (1995), the Jane Austen adaptation ""Emma"" (1996), the eventual Best Picture-winning romance ""Shakespeare in Love"" (1998), for which Paltrow herself won an Oscar for Best Actress, and the revered psychological thriller ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999). Throughout this period, Paltrow dated fellow rising stars Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck. The 2000s brought Paltrow to more offbeat fare, such as Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), the action-adventure movie ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (2004), and the drama ""Proof"" (2005). In 2008, she signed onto what would become the beginnings of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing Pepper Potts in ""Iron Man"" (2008). Around the same time, Paltrow launched a lifestyle newsletter (later turned website) called Goop. Paltrow reprised the role in ""Iron Man 2"" (2010), ""The Avengers"" (2012), and ""Iron Man 3"" (2013), all the while playing a recurring role on Ryan Murphy's hit musical dramedy series ""Glee"" (Fox 2009-2015). Going forward, Paltrow starred predominantly in Marvel films. In 2017, Paltrow lent her voice to the array of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. In 2018, Paltrow married Brad Falchuk; the following year, she appeared in the series ""The Politician"" (Netflix 2019-), which he produced with Ryan Murphy."
Chris Pratt,"Though audiences the world over knew him for his roles in blockbusters like ""Jurassic World"" (2015) and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), many of Chris Pratt's biggest fans discovered him in his role as Andy Dwyer on the beloved sitcom ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-2015). Born in Virginia, Minnesota in 1979 and raised in Lake Stevens, Washington, Pratt was active in high school wrestling. Though he exuded confidence and was known to proclaim that he would one day be rich and famous, his path to acting was circuitous. He enrolled briefly at community college and later lived for a time in his van in Maui, Hawaii. Though he participated in dinner theater, Pratt only later pursued a full time acting career upon moving to Los Angeles. He was working as a server at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in 2000 when he happened to meet Rae Dawn Chong, who cast him in her directorial debut, the short film ""Cursed Part 3"" (2000). Two years later, Pratt was cast as Bright Abbott on the drama series ""Everwood"" (WB, 2002-06), a part he stuck with until the show wrapped in 2006. He next played the character Che for two years on the series ""The O.C."" (WB, 2003-07) before appearing in the comedy ""Take Me Home Tonight"" (2007). Pratt met actor Anna Faris during filming, and the two were married in 2009, the same year Pratt appeared in the acclaimed sports drama ""Moneyball"" (2009) and joined the cast of  ""Parks and Recreation."" Pratt continued with the show even as his fame in movies climbed. He appeared in Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012) in 2012, and joined the Marvel universe in 2014 taking on the role of Peter ""Star Lord"" Quill in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). Now a legitimate movie star, moved on to star in the latter-day sequel ""Jurassic World"" (2015) as dinosaur trainer Owen before appearing in the science fiction drama ""Passengers"" (2016) and Antoine Fuqua's remake of the Western ""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016). He reprised the role of Peter Quill for ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017) and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), and then reprised the role of Owen for ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" (2018). Pratt and Faris divorced in 2018, but Pratt soon began seeing Katherine Schwarzenegger. The pair married in 2019, the same year Pratt played Peter Quill once again in the smash hit ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019)."
Zoe Saldana,"After spending most of her youth training as a dancer, Zoe Saldana made the transition to acting on screen after an attention-getting performance in the stage musical ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."" Saldana began landing television and feature roles almost immediately, including ""Center Stage"" (2000), in which she was able to showcase her years of ballet training. Despite the fast start, her career had trouble lifting off after a series of disappointing film like ""Get Over It"" (2001) and ""Crossroads"" (2002), though she did make fleeting appearances in large studio fare like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" (2003) and ""The Terminal"" (2004).

Bradley Cooper,"Handsome and irreverently funny, Bradley Cooper's combination of romantic leading man and hilarious character actor chops helped him progress from TV guest spots to memorable parts in features in a relatively short amount of time. After attracting attention for his likable role as Jennifer Garner's reporter friend on ""Alias"" (ABC, 2001-06), Cooper fearlessly made his first major big screen impression as the unlikable groom in ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005). He regained audience's affection in lesser fare like ""Failure to Launch"" (2006) and, in testament to his charisma, emerged unscathed from Sandra Bullock's notorious bomb ""All About Steve"" (2008). Cooper ensured his own launch with the lead in the critical and box office juggernaut ""The Hangover"" (2009) and proved an invaluable member of the romantic, dramatic ensemble ""He's Just Not That Into You"" (2009) and ""Valentine's Day"" (2010) casts. Graduating to full-fledged stardom with a flashy role in ""The A-Team"" (2010), Cooper continued to rise as a bankable, talented and very much in-demand movie star, which was confirmed with a return to box-office prominence with ""The Hangover Part II"" (2011) and his star turn in David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012) opposite Jennifer Lawrence. That trio reunited twice more for ""American Hustle"" (2013) and ""Joy"" (2015), while Cooper continued starring in films ranging from Clint Eastwood's drama ""American Sniper"" (2014) to James Gunn's blockbuster action-comedy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) and its 2017 sequel, in which he provided the voice of Rocket, a raccoon-like mutant with serious anger management issues. Whether starring in comedies, thrillers or romantic dramas - as well as making a tabloid splash in the wake of rumored romances with some of Hollywood's loveliest leading ladies - Cooper propelled himself into becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars."
Dave Bautista,"David Michael Bautista Jr. was born on Jan. 18, 1969 in Arlington, VA. Following involvement with crime in his teen years and early adulthood, Bautista found personal reinvention in bodybuilding, which led to him launching a career in wrestling at the age of 30. After training under wrestler and manager Arthur Anoaʻi Sr., Bautista signed with the World Wrestling Federation in 2000, performing on television series like ""WWE SmackDown"" (UPN/The CW/MyNetworkTV/Syfy/USA/Fox 1999-). After more than a decade of earning acclaim as a professional wrestler under aliases including Deacon and Leviathan, Bautista expanded his horizons to mixed martial arts. Around the same time, Bautista explored the beginnings of an acting career, appearing in films such as ""House of the Rising Sun"" (2011), ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" (2012), and ""Riddick"" (2013). Bautista's proverbial big break as an actor came with his casting as Drax the Destroyer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). He would go on to play the character in additional MCU films, all the while landing noteworthy appearances in high profile movies like ""Spectre"" (2015) and ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017)."
Vin Diesel,"An overnight action-film sensation who intrigued audiences when he seemingly emerged from nowhere in the summer of 2001, Vin Diesel actually made his first mark on the movie business as a filmmaker. His first two independent films screened at the Cannes and Sundance Film Festivals after which the hulking, clean-shaven actor had a breakthrough role as imposing antihero Riddick in the cult-favorite sci-fi film ""Pitch Black"" (2000). He was quickly snapped up by Hollywood and transformed into a movie star with high-octane hits ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) and ""xXx"" (2002). Diesel found further box-office success with the Disney comedy ""The Pacifier"" (2005) and went on to receive decent reviews for his dramatic performance in ""Find Me Guilty"" (2006), but audiences were generally reluctant to accept him in anything but sequels to his signature action films. The hype that surrounded the actor's rush to stardom eventually gave way to a period of career stagnation, but he bounced back in a big way with his prominent return for the 2009 sequel ""Fast & Furious"" and its reliably popular later installments, including the super-sized ""Fast & Furious 6."""
Michael Rooker,"Michael Rooker's harrowing turn in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" (1986) minted him as an in-demand character actor specializing in intense and often dangerous characters in ""Mississippi Burning"" (1988) and ""JFK"" (1991), but he would not achieve true mainstream stardom until the 2010s with exuberant and even sympathetic performances on ""The Walking Dead"" (AMC, 2010- ) and in the Marvel Films cult favorite ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). Born in Jasper, Alabama on April 6, 1955, Michael Rooker relocated to Chicago, Illinois with his mother and eight siblings after the divorce of his parents. There, his family struggled to make ends meet and put him and his brothers and sisters through school. Initially, Rooker viewed the Marines as his career of choice, but after landing roles in productions, he shifted his focus to acting. He gained entry to the prestigious Goodman School of Drama, and then made a name in local theater productions. Bit roles in television and film productions lensed in the Windy City soon followed, with his breakthrough, ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" coming in 1986. Directed in stark, realistic tones by Chicago filmmaker John McNaughton, the indie horror-drama followed Rooker's brooding, monstrous loner - based on real-life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas - as he cut a swath of death through the underbelly of a rotting industrial city. His unnerving performance - equally vulnerable and menacing - earned Rooker an Independent Spirit Award nomination and the attention of Hollywood casting agents, who tapped him for a wide variety of projects. Many of his early roles were in the vein of ""Henry,"" like a brutish Klan member in Alan Parker's ""Mississippi Burning"" and a psychopathic husband in ""Sea of Love"" (1989). But he soon added more sympathetic roles to his growing c.v., including an assistant district attorney that challenged Kevin Costner's Jim Garrison in Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" (1991) and Tom Cruise's racing rival turned friend in ""Days of Thunder"" (1991). He soon settled into a string of character turns that tapped his imposing physicality - Rooker held a black belt in martial arts - in order to provide believable support to such veteran action stars as Sylvester Stallone in ""Cliffhanger"" (1993), Kurt Russell in ""Tombstone"" (1993), Chow-Yun Fat in ""The Replacement Killers"" (1998) and Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""The Sixth Day"" (2000). But he also remained a consistent presence in dramas, most notably as Jena Malone's supportive uncle in Anjelica Huston's ""Bastard Out of Carolina"" (Showtime, 1996), and even the occasional comedy like Kevin Smith's ""Mallrats"" (1996). As he entered into his third decade as an actor in the late '90s and 2000s, Rooker remained extraordinarily busy with both feature and television appearances; though many of these were unremarkable horror or suspense projects for the direct-to-video or -cable market, a few stood out from the pack, including Walter Hill's ""Undisputed"" (2002) and ""Slither"" (2006), an amusing horror comedy directed by ""Scooby-Doo"" (2002) and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) writer James Gunn. Rooker would go on to become one of Gunn's repertory players, appearing in nearly all of his directorial projects, including the violent comic book spoof ""Super"" 2010), while also enjoying something of a comeback as repentant redneck Merle Dixon on AMC's hit horror series ""The Walking Dead."" In 2014, Gunn cast Rooker as the blue-skinned intergalactic bounty hunter Yondu Udonta in ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" an adaptation of a relatively obscure Marvel Comics title. The film was an unqualified critical and box office success, and led to an even more popular sequel, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017), which provided Rooker with what was arguably his most affecting on-screen moment when he confessed his fatherly love for Chris Pratt's hero, Peter Quill, seconds before his death. The success of both ""Guardians"" films reignited Rooker's film and television career, and led to his casting in such high-profile projects as the third season of HBO's ""True Detective"" (2014- ), Blumhouse Pictures' horror revamp of ""Fantasy Island"" (2020), the ninth entry in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise (2020) and ""The Suicide Squad"" (2021), which marked Gunn's writing and directing debut for DC Films."
Chris Evans,"Actor Chris Evans began his acting career in typical fashion, but it was his rapid rise to stardom which was unusual. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade, Evans started out appearing in school plays and theater camp; from there it was a quick jump to local community theater, and later, an internship for a casting office. Once Evans made friends with a few agents on the job, it was a straight shot to television and blockbuster features. One of the more talented of the fair-haired, pretty-boy actors to emerge in the early years of the new millennium, Evans scored with roles in a succession of high-profile releases. His breakthrough came in 2005 when he was tapped to play the role of the Human Torch in director Tim Story's adaptation of the Marvel Comics classic ""The Fantastic Four"" and its subsequent sequel, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (2007). By the time he starred in ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" (2010) and as Captain America, one of the central pillars of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in films including ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011), ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), Evans was a star assured of accomplishing even greater things. Simultaneously, his work starring in and directing romantic drama ""Before We Go"" (2014) and starring in family drama ""Gifted"" (2017) showed off his non-superhero range."
Scarlett Johansson,"Scarlett Johansson moved from being an indie darling to one of the most recognizable actresses in the world thanks to her standing as a member of Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012). A native of Manhattan, she began studying acting as a child and made her screen debut at the age of nine in ""North"" (1994). The actress played the daughter of John Ritter in the Rob Reiner comedy. Similarly, she was cast as Sean Connery's daughter in the drama ""Just Cause"" (1995). The actress earned her first starring role playing opposite Aleksa Palladino in ""Manny & Lo"" (1996) about a pair of sisters running away from foster care. She was featured in director Eric Schaeffer's ""If Lucy Fell"" (1996) and ""Fall"" (1997). She had roles as well in the broad comedy ""Home Alone 3"" (1997) and Robert Redford's ""The Horse Whisperer"" (1998). Johansson began establishing her indie credentials when she teamed with Thora Birch for Terry Zwigoff's dark comedy ""Ghost World"" (2001). After a supporting role in the action comedy ""Eight Legged Freaks"" (2002), the actress began her march towards stardom in earnest. Director Sofia Coppola cast her as the disillusioned young woman who hangs out with Bill Murray's jaded actor during a trip to Tokyo in ""Lost in Translation"" (2003). She followed with a role as the muse to Colin Firth's Johannes Vermeer in ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" (2003). The following year she starred with future ""Avengers"" co-star Chris Evans in ""The Perfect Score"" (2004) and teamed with John Travolta in ""A Love Song for Bobby Long"" (2004). She would add roles opposite Helen Hunt in ""A Good Woman"" (2004) and as Dennis Quaid's daughter in ""In Good Company"" (2004). Woody Allen cast the actress as the lead in his ""Match Point"" (2005), and Michael Bay did likewise for his thriller ""The Island"" (2005). She would work with Allen again when he cast her alongside Hugh Jackman as a journalism student investigating a serial killer. She continued to work at an impressive clip, starring in ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006), ""The Prestige"" (2006), ""The Nanny Diaries"" (2007), and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (2008) in succession. Allen again used the actress, this time partnered with Rebecca Hall and Javier Bardem for ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" (2008). The actress also began mixing in Broadway performances, earning a Tony for her role opposite Liev Schreiber in ""A View from the Bridge."" She went from drama to blockbuster, though, when she agreed to play former assassin Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Johansson made her debut as the character in the Robert Downey Jr. vehicle ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and brought the character to fruition fully in ""The Avengers."" Outside of the superhero world, she starred with Matt Damon in ""We Bought a Zoo"" (2011) and portrayed actress Janet Leigh in ""Hitchcock"" (2012). Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt cast her in his directorial debut ""Don Jon"" (2013). Even though she didn't appear on screen, Johansson gained notice for voicing a virtual assistant that Joaquin Phoenix forms an unhealthy bond with in Spike Jonze's ""Her"" (2013). She continued her trend of working with strong directors when she co-starred in Jon Favreau's ""Chef"" (2014). The Marvel world soon beckoned, however, and she returned to playing Black Widow for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015). Having proven her physical prowess in the superhero films, she starred as a genetically altered woman in Luc Besson's thriller ""Lucy"" (2014). She would later join the ensemble cast of the Coen Brothers' Hollywood comedy ""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016) and starred in the live-action remake of the anime classic ""Ghost in the Shell"" (2017). She also starred with Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer in the comedy ""Rough Night"" (2017). Her run as Black Widow reached a whole new level with ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). The three films would combine to take in more than $5-billion dollars at the box office worldwide. She gained positive reviews for her role opposite Adam Driver in ""Marriage Story"" (2019) playing an actress going through a divorce. She also appeared in Taika Waititi's inventive ""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019). After appearing as Natasha Romanoff alongside a variety of other superheroes, Johansson's character was finally given a stand-alone film with ""Black Widow"" (2020)."
Sebastian Stan,"Some actors are blessed with good looks, and Sebastian Stan was definitely one of those. However, across numerous roles over his career, which began in the early 2000s, he also showed tremendous emotional and physical range, making him more than just a pretty face. He showed poise in his varied roles, whether kicking back with Captain America and Black Widow, dealing with the drama of privileged teenagers, or bringing The Mad Hatter to modern times. Born in Romania in 1982, Stan lived there with his mother until they moved to New York in 1994. He was taken by the stage at a young age, appearing in numerous school productions before eventually attending Rutgers University's Mason Gross School of the Arts for acting. While still attending school, Stan got his professional start on ""Law & Order"" (NBC 1990-2010) in 2003. He also appeared in a few independent films, most notably ""Tony n' Tina's Wedding"" (2004) and ""Red Doors"" (2005). Graduating from Rutgers, he almost immediately filmed the drama ""The Architect"" (2006) and the supernatural thriller ""The Covenant"" (2006). His first breakthrough came with a recurring role on the teen drama ""Gossip Girl"" (CW 2007-2012), followed by a small role in Jonathan Demme's family drama ""Rachel Getting Married"" (2008). He then joined the cast of the short-lived alternate-reality drama ""Kings"" (NBC 2009). The disappointment of that series' swift cancellation was tempered by key supporting roles in the critically-acclaimed drama ""Black Swan"" (2010) and the cult-favorite comedy ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" (2010). After he appeared as Captain America's sidekick Bucky Barnes in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011), Stan co-starred in the Washington D.C.-based miniseries ""Political Animals"" (USA 2012) and the film ""Gone"" (2012). He also appeared as The Mad Hatter in several episodes of the fantasy ""Once Upon a Time"" (ABC 2011- ) before reprising his role as Bucky in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014)."
Anthony Mackie,"Actor Anthony Mackie rose to prominence with powerful turns on the New York stage in acclaimed productions like ""Up Against the Wind"" and ""Talk."" His performances eventually brought him to Hollywood, where he impressed in his debut as a formidable foe to Eminem in ""8 Mile"" (2002). Mackie soon graduated to supporting roles and the occasional lead for major directors like Spike Lee with ""She Hate Me"" (2004) and Clint Eastwood with ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2005), while maintaining an interest in independent product like ""Half Nelson"" (2005) and ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008). The depth and strength of his talents in these projects and many others, including the much-anticipated Notorious B.I.G. biopic ""Notorious"" (2009) signified that Mackie was among the best actors working in film and stage in the early millennium. His move into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Falcon in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) solidified his position as one of Hollywood's most well-rounded actors."
Don Cheadle,"Absolutely engaging and immensely talented, actor Don Cheadle rightfully earned his reputation as one of his generation's most versatile and committed performers. After years of thankless guest appearances on TV dramas and sitcoms, Cheadle gained attention with the role of the fastidious hotel manager of ""The Golden Palace"" (CBS, 1992-93), a spin-off from the beloved sitcom, ""The Golden Girls"" (CBS, 1985-1992). The chameleon-like Cheadle broke out with an acclaimed performance in Carl Franklin's crime thriller ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" (1995) and continued the streak with remarkable work in highly-lauded films like ""Boogie Nights"" (1997) and ""Out of Sight"" (1998). He officially made Hollywood's A-list as one of Danny Ocean's crack team of con men in Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001), but it was his performance as real-life hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina in ""Hotel Rwanda"" (2004) that earned Cheadle the most effusive critical praise of his career. He played an integral role in the Oscar-winning ensemble drama ""Crash"" (2005) prior to turning in a tour de force performance in the radio DJ biopic ""Talk to Me"" (2007). In addition to the hugely successful sequels to ""Ocean's Eleven,"" the actor was frequently seen in such big-budget productions as the superhero blockbuster sequel ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and related films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016). He later returned to television as the star of the highly-regarded cable comedy ""House of Lies"" (Showtime, 2012-16) and made his feature directing debut with the impressionistic biopic ""Miles Ahead"" (2016), in which he also starred as mercurial jazz icon Miles Davis. Cheadle's ability to virtually disappear into any role kept him at the very top of Hollywood's list of ""go to"" actors."
Benedict Cumberbatch,"One of the most well-respected British thespians of his generation, Benedict Cumberbatch may have taken the classic route to acting fame: spouting off Shakespeare at drama school, followed by BBC roles and eventually films, but his type of fame is decidedly 21st century. Cumberbatch is beloved by a very devoted cadre of fans, who line the stranger corners of the internet with all sorts of fan art and memes dedicated to their favorite actor. From Oscar nominated prestige dramas to Marvel superhero tentpole blockbusters, there was no limit to Cumberbatch's range, one might even call him a leading man disguised as an eccentric character actor. Born on July 19. 1976 in London to actors Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham, Cumberbatch came from literal royalty: his third cousin sixteen times removed was Richard III. While away at boarding school, Cumberbatch became interested in acting. He made his stage debut at the age of 12, playing Titania, Queen of the Fairies, in a school production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" Before university, Cumberbatch took a gap year to teach English at a Tibetan monastery, which began a lifetime of studying Buddhist philosophy. After earning his masters in Classical Acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), Cumberbatch began working on the stage. His breakthrough in the UK came when he was cast as Stephen Hawking in the miniseries ""Hawking"" (BBC, 2004), soon followed by an acclaimed role in the film ""Amazing Grace"" (2006). Cumberbatch next earned his first lead role, in the miniseries ""The Last Enemy"" (BBC, 2008), before landing the part that would make him a cause celebrae on both sides of the pond: Sherlock Holmes. ""Sherlock"" (BBC/PBS, 2012-) was a thoroughly modern take on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic sleuth: Cumberbatch's Holmes was acerbic and dangerous, and with Martin Freeman's Watson as his foil, Cumberbatch got to delightfully chew the scenery. His performance in the third season netted him an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. Speaking of movies, Cumberbatch's next big role was as a lovesick closeted spy hunting down a mole in Tomas Alfredsson's acclaimed take on the John le Careé classic ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" (2011). Thanks to his growing online fandom, Cumberbatch soon found himself on the radar of major filmmakers casting big tentpole projects: for Peter Jackson he lended his voice to the villainous dragon Smaug across three films: ""The Hobbit; An Unexpected Journey"" (2012), ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013), and ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014), while also taking on the role of the legendary sci-fi heavy, Khan, for JJ Abrams's ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013). For his turn as Alan Turing, inventor of the modern computer who was tormented by British law for his homosexuality, in the drama ""The Imitation Game"" (2014), Cumberbatch received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. This also lead to Cumberbatch signing an open letter, published in The Guardian on January 31, 2015, asking the British government to pardon all gay and bisexual men who were convicted under the same defunct ""indecency"" laws as Alan Turing. Cumberbatch was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2015 for his services on behalf of the arts and charity. For his next role, Cumberbatch took on the titular role of ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) in Marvel's most psychedelic superhero adventure yet. He would reprise the role for ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). Cumberbatch earned another Emmy nomination for his lead role in the miniseries ""Patrick Melrose"" (HBO, 2018), before taking things full circle to the beginning of his career by taking the job of president of LAMDA, his old alma mater. Cumberbatch could next be seen in Sam Mendes' World War I drama ""1917"" (2019)."
Chiwetel Ejiofor,"With a disarming façade and subtle intensity, British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor quietly embarked upon a film career after several successful stage performances with a noticeable supporting role as an interpreter in Steven Spielberg's historical drama, ""Amistad"" (1997). From there, Ejiofor was able to carve out an impressive career in a short amount of time, though most audiences would have been hard-pressed to place the name or face. But he did earn high critical praise, particularly for his low-key performance in Stephen Frears' gritty urban drama, ""Dirty Pretty Things"" (2002). Though he earned several small awards for the role, Ejiofor remained a relative unknown in the United States. He sought to change that with roles in the popular British romantic comedy ""Love Actually"" (2003), Woody Allen's tragicomedy ""Melinda and Melinda"" (2004), and by playing a sassy drag queen in ""Kinky Boots"" (2005), which earned him his first Golden Globe nomination. Ejiofor graduated to bigger studio films, supporting Denzel Washington in both ""Inside Man"" (2006) and ""American Gangster"" (2007), while delivering a fine turn as the leader of a rebel group in the dystopian thriller ""Children of Men"" (2006), all of which illustrated that it was only a matter of time before he became a household name."
Rachel McAdams,"Canadian actress Rachel McAdams first came to the attention of U.S. audiences playing a pair of über-bitchy teen queens in both ""The Hot Chick"" (2004) and ""Mean Girls"" (2004). Thanks to those rather harsh characters, audiences were understandably surprised by her effectively heartwarming performances in the sentimental Nicholas Sparks romance ""The Notebook"" (2004) and as a likeable girl-next-door in the comedy smash ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005). The sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette, sometimes pink-haired actress enjoyed roles just as unpredictable as her appearance, delivering all of them with the same sparkling panache as her flair for personal style. Her romances with actors Ryan Gosling, Josh Lucas and Michael Sheen fascinated the press and fans alike, proving the actress' appeal extended beyond the screen. After turning to horror for the compelling ""Red Eye"" (2005), McAdams threw moviegoers for a loop yet again with starring roles in the retro thriller ""Married Life"" (2008) and in an adaptation of the best-selling novel ""The Traveler's Wife"" (2008), before playing a junior reporter in the political thriller ""State of Play"" (2009). That same year, she co-starred in the studio blockbuster ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) and later reprised her role in the sequel, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" (2011), while starring opposite Owen Wilson in Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" (2011), starring in the second season of cable drama ""True Detective"" (HBO 2014- ), and receiving an Academy Award nomination for her work in the ensemble drama ""Spotlight"" (2015). Thanks to wide-ranging performances and an utterly likable onscreen persona, McAdams kept audiences on their toes in a variety of films."
Benedict Wong,"A regular fixture in both British TV and American cinema, prolific character actor Benedict Wong carved out a career playing parts on both sides of the law before landing his most imposing role as Kublai Khan in historical epic ""Marco Polo"" (Netflix, 2014-). Born in Eccles, Greater Manchester to Hong Kong-born parents in 1971, Wong studied Performing Arts at Salford College before making his on-screen debut in the ""Small Metal Jacket"" episode of anthology series ""Screenplay"" (BBC2, 1986-1993). Following one-off appearances in the likes of gentle comedy ""Last of the Summer Wine"" (BBC1, 1973-2010), medical drama ""Cardiac Arrest"" (BBC1, 1994-96) and detective show ""Cracker"" (ITV, 1993-2006), Wong landed his first recurring role as DC Frankie Li in Lynda La Plante's ""Supply & Demand"" (ITV, 1997-98). Wong stuck with the same profession when he was cast as David Chiu for nine episodes of long-running police drama ""The Bill"" (ITV, 1984-2010), and went onto add fantasy miniseries ""Arabian Nights"" (BBC, 2000) and hitman comedy ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" (2001) to his resume before making his first Hollywood appearance as a sniper in the espionage thriller ""Spy Game"" (2001). Wong then showcased his comic skills with roles as Sean Lock's naive flatmate Errol in cult sitcom ""15 Storeys High"" (BBC3, 2002-04) and gay theatre nurse Terry in surreal hospital-based ""TLC"" (BBC2, 2002) before returning to more dramatic fare, playing mortuary assistant Guo Yi in illegal immigrant tale ""Dirty Pretty Things"" (2002), Pete Cheng in Paul Abbott's political thriller ""State of Play"" (BBC1, 2003) and a medic in Michael Winterbottom's sci-fi love story ""Code 46"" (2003). Following minor roles in ensemble drama ""On A Clear Day"" (2005) and Winterbottom's film-within-a-film ""A Cock & Bull Story"" (2005), Wong played frazzled navigator Trey in Danny Boyle's space epic ""Sunshine"" (2007) and assistant Ed Gore in ""Frankenstein"" (ITV, 2007), starred as the mute Chinese gardener Kung Sang in big-screen comedy ""Grow Your Own"" (2007) and appeared as financial guru William Kwan in the adaptation of Belgian comic book ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" (2008). After venturing into children's TV to play the villainous Li in ""Spirit Warriors"" (CBBC, 2010), Wong landed minor roles in neo-noir ""Shanghai"" (2010), Aung San Suu Kyi biopic ""The Lady"" (2011) and spy spoof ""Johnny English Reborn"" (2011), as well as voicing world-famous pianist Lang Lang in live-action/animation hybrid ""The Flying Machine"" (2011). Following his performance as Vietnamese drug dealer Vincent in gritty drama ""Top Boy"" (Channel 4, 2011-) Wong worked with Ridley Scott, playing ship pilot Ravel in sci-fi horror ""Prometheus"" (2012), and appeared as mobsters in Jason Statham vehicle ""Redemption"" (2013), superhero sequel ""Kick-Ass 2"" (2013) and James Corden's black comedy ""The Wrong Mans"" (BBC2, 2014-). Wong then landed arguably his most high-profile role when he was cast as Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan Dynasty, in big-budget 13th Century epic ""Marco Polo"" (Netflix, 2014-). Between seasons of that series, Wong co-starred with Matt Damon in the science fiction hit ""The Martian"" (2016) and Benedict Cumberbatch in the Marvel Comics thriller ""Doctor Strange"" (2016)."
Mads Mikkelsen,"An intense presence in international film since the late 1990s, actor Mads Mikkelsen enjoyed considerable popularity in his native Denmark with turns as brooding, often violent men on both sides of the law in ""Pusher"" (1996) and on the television series ""Rejseholdet (Unit One)"" (DR1, 2000-04) before leaping to stardom in America as men of action in ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010). Despite his flinty, often taciturn screen image, Mikkelsen also excelled in comedies like ""The Green Butchers"" (2003), as well as more sympathetic turns in the Oscar-nominated ""After the Wedding"" (2006). His performance as the icy terrorist Le Chiffre in the James Bond thriller ""Casino Royale"" (2006) brought him to the attention of Hollywood, which cast him largely in period action features like ""Titans"" and ""The Three Musketeers"" (2011). A Best Actor Award win at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival as a man haunted by child abuse allegations in ""The Hunt"" (2012) underscored his standing as one of Europe's most popular leading men. His subsequent casting as the iconic serial killer Hannibal Lecter on the TV series ""Hannibal"" (NBC, 2013-15) also highlighted an acting career on a skyrocketing trajectory."
Tilda Swinton,"Tilda Swinton was an Academy Award-winning British actress who achieved widespread praise for her daring roles in acclaimed films like ""Adaptation"" (2002), ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" (2011), and ""Michael Clayton"" (2007). Born into a privileged family in London (her father's Scottish roots trace all the way back to the Middle Ages), Swinton attended various boarding schools as a young girl, which she found isolating and lonely. When it came time to attend college, Swinton chose the University of Cambridge, where she would go on to earn a degree in social and political sciences. It was at Cambridge that Swinton first became involved in acting. She began appearing in plays while studying at Cambridge, and after graduation joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company. Swinton made her debut with the Royal Shakespeare Company by appearing in ""Measure for Measure."" Swinton continued honing her acting craft on the London stage throughout the 1980s, but by the end of the decade she began transitioning into film acting. It was during this period that Swinton appeared in a number of experimental films by the English director Derek Jarman. These films included ""Caravaggio"" (1986), ""The Last of England"" (1988), and ""The Garden"" (1990). Swinton continued acting in independent films throughout the 90s, and although many of these films were not widely seen by the public, she consistently earned plaudits from critics. At the turn of the century, with over a decade of acting experience behind her, Swinton began making the transition into more mainstream films. She appeared in award-winning films like ""Adaptation"" and ""Broken Flowers"" (2005) during this period, as well as the big budget action film ""Constantine"" (2005). Then in 2007 she played an unscrupulous lawyer in the Tony Gilroy-directed legal thriller ""Michael Clayton."" Her supporting role in the film earned Swinton her first Oscar. In the years that followed her role in ""Michael Clayton,"" Swinton continued wowing both critics and audiences with her wide-ranging roles in films like ""We Need to Talk About Kevin,"" ""Trainwreck"" (2015), ""A Bigger Splash"" (2015), and the Wes Anderson animated film ""Isle of Dogs"" (2018). 2018 was also the year Swinton appeared alongside Dakota Johnson in the fantasy horror film ""Suspiria"" (2018), which was helmed by the Italian director Luca Guadagnino, who previously earned an Oscar nod for directing the 2017 romance drama ""Call Me By Your Name"" (2017)."
Chris Hemsworth,"Tall, muscular and exceptionally handsome, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth became a star in the U.S. with a series of well-received genre films. He was a household name in his native country while starring on the popular drama series, ""Home and Away"" (7 Network, 1988- ), playing an opinionated student navigating his way through high school in a seaside town. He quickly became a sci-fi sensation across the pond with a brief but memorable role in the J.J. Abrams reboot of the worldwide phenomenon ""Star Trek"" (2009) as Capt. James T. Kirk's ill-fated father. But it was not until he landed the lead role in the film version of the comic book hero ""Thor"" (2011) - beating out his younger brother, fellow heartthrob Liam, in the process - that Hemsworth truly flexed his muscles, establishing himself as one of the most charismatic young actors of the moment. Lionsgate films quickly capitalized on Hemsworth's popularity by releasing the long-delayed horror feature ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012), co-written by Joss Whedon. Ironically, it was Whedon who later directed the young star in the superhero blockbuster ""The Avengers"" (2012), bringing together ""Thor"" and Marvel Studios' other franchise films. Along with his continuing screen presence as the Nordic superhero, Hemsworth expanded with range with films ranging from the thriller ""Blackhat"" (2015), Ron Howard's sailing drama ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (2015), and two fantasy films based on fairy tales, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016). As talented as he was attractive, Hemsworth was without a doubt, a leading man to watch."
Mark Ruffalo,"Like many other actors who were tagged ""best of a generation,"" Mark Ruffalo's roots were in theater and independent film where his honest, open character approach was applauded. His breakout stage role in Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed ""This Is Our Youth"" led Lonergan to give Ruffalo the lead in his film directorial debut ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000), which earned countless festival awards and had critics buzzing about the little-known actor's subtle, compelling performance as a cerebral but aimless young adult with an arrest record and a pregnant teenage girlfriend. Hollywood came courting, but struggled with a tidy niche in which to put the darkly handsome actor; first offering him small but effective character roles as ""conflicted"" types in big budget thrillers like ""Collateral"" (2004) before unsuccessfully making the understated actor into a bland leading man in romantic comedies like ""Just Like Heaven"" (2005). Ruffalo eventually found an appropriate arena somewhere between the multiplex and the art house, favored by character-driven directors like Jane Campion, David Fincher, Steven Zaillian and eventually Martin Scorsese - all of whom capitalized on the actor's talent for believably disappearing into complex, empathetic characters."
Scarlett Johansson,"Scarlett Johansson moved from being an indie darling to one of the most recognizable actresses in the world thanks to her standing as a member of Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012). A native of Manhattan, she began studying acting as a child and made her screen debut at the age of nine in ""North"" (1994). The actress played the daughter of John Ritter in the Rob Reiner comedy. Similarly, she was cast as Sean Connery's daughter in the drama ""Just Cause"" (1995).

The three films would combine to take in more than $5-billion dollars at the box office worldwide. She gained positive reviews for her role opposite Adam Driver in ""Marriage Story"" (2019) playing an actress going through a divorce. She also appeared in Taika Waititi's inventive ""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019). After appearing as Natasha Romanoff alongside a variety of other superheroes, Johansson's character was finally given a stand-alone film with ""Black Widow"" (2020)."
Jeremy Renner,"After years of struggle, actor Jeremy Renner earned a reputation as a reliable lead in dark-themed dramas, thanks initially to his stellar portrayal of infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in the biopic, ""Dahmer"" (2002). With no qualms about taking a turn to the dark side, Renner added to his esteem with acclaimed indie turns as a white supremacist in ""Neo Ned"" (2005) and a sexist boss in ""North Country"" (2005). He tackled more complex roles with sterling performances as a former L.A.P.D. cop in ""S.W.A.T."" (2003) and as the intimidating Wood Hite, cousin to Frank and Jesse James, in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007). Though a recognizable face, Renner finally broke through as a household name following his critically lauded turn as an on-edge bomb disposal expert operating in the Oscar-winning Iraq War thriller, ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009). From there, he earned himself an Oscar nomination with a finely tuned turn as a career criminal in Ben Affleck's widely hailed crime drama, ""The Town"" (2010), which soon led to roles in blockbuster movies like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), ""The Avengers"" (2011) and ""The Bourne Legacy"" (2012). With each critical nod, Renner secured a firmer footing in Hollywood as a recognizable and dependable face in a variety of feature films."
Corey Stoll,"A hardworking and talented character actor who immersed himself into each character he played, Corey Stoll gained critical recognition for portraying one of the most iconic literary figures of all time in a film written and directed by Woody Allen. While lesser actors might have been intimidated by playing Ernest Hemingway in an Allen film, Stoll brought the author back to life in ""Midnight in Paris"" (2011) with a nuanced, scene-stealing performance. Growing up with a background in experimental theater and performance art, Stoll eventually made his way to Hollywood and quickly landed supporting roles on television dramas and acclaimed features such as ""North Country"" (2005). He often returned to his theater roots; in fact, it was a Broadway appearance that introduced Stoll to cinematic auteur Allen, who invited him to read for a part in ""Midnight in Paris."" Landing the role of Hemingway put Stoll on the map, and set him up for a long and successful career as an actor of the stage and screen."
Bobby Cannavale,"A native New Yorker who managed to avoid the ethnic typecasting that limited so many other actors with similar backgrounds, Bobby Cannavale was an Emmy Award-winning actor known for procedural TV dramas as well as big screen comedy and numerous Broadway accomplishments. Some of Cannavale's best-known roles found him in uniform like FDNY paramedic Bobby Caffey on ""Third Watch"" (NBC, 1999-2005), boss of ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" (2009), and his Emmy-winning guest appearances as Will's cop boyfriend on ""Will & Grace"" (NBC, 1998-2006). But while he certainly scored as ""regular Joes"" - including his charming work in the indie favorite ""The Station Agent"" (2003) - he easily adapted into a wide range of characters and consistently enjoyed cross-medium success that few actors could match. In fact, he translated his easygoing appeal across a wide spectrum of projects like ""Snakes on a Plane"" (2005) and ""Fast Food Nation"" (2006), while also appearing steadily on stage with roles in ""Mauritius"" (2008), ""The Talk"" (2008) and ""The Motherf**ker with the Hat"" (2011).

Whether his role was large or small, Cannavale always delivered standout performances that garnered the actor considerable attention."
Judy Greer,"Playing lanky, clumsy and unforgettable characters who often stole scene after scene from her A-list co-stars, Judy Greer turned attractive awkwardness into an art form. The minute the actress stepped foot on camera, she exuded a natural comedic flair in films such as ""What Women Want"" (2000) with Mel Gibson, ""The Wedding Planner"" (2001) with Jennifer Lopez, and ""13 Going on 30"" (2004) with Jennifer Garner. Greer also thrived on the small screen with hit shows like ""Arrested Development"" (Fox, 2003-06) and ""Californication"" (Showtime, 2007-14). She widened her horizons with the supernatural thriller ""The Village"" (2004) and Wes Craven's horror flick ""Cursed"" (2005), before returning to more comedic roles in ""American Dreamz"" (2006) and ""The Amateurs"" (2006). By the time she joined the cast of animated hit ""Archer"" (FX 2009- ), co-starred opposite George Clooney in ""The Descendants"" (2011) and starred in cult favorite sitcom ""Married"" (FX 2014-15), Greer was firmly established as a top character actress capable of playing in a variety of genres in film and on television. She added a key big screen role to her career when she played the resourceful daughter of Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode in ""Halloween"" (2018)."

He would go on to star in memorable films like ""The Candidate"" (1972), ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972), ""The Way We Were"" (1973), and ""All the President's Men"" (1976). In 1978, Redford's business partner Sterling Van Wagenen was inspired to launch an independent film festival, leading to the pair collaborating on the Sundance Film Festival, which has since become one of the most relevant and respected film festivals in the world. Around this same time, Redford also took a keen interest in directing, stepping behind the camera to helm the acclaimed family drama ""Ordinary People"" (1980).

The depth and strength of his talents in these projects and many others, including the much-anticipated Notorious B.I.G. biopic ""Notorious"" (2009) signified that Mackie was among the best actors working in film and stage in the early millennium. His move into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Falcon in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) solidified his position as one of Hollywood's most well-rounded actors."
Chris Pratt,"Though audiences the world over knew him for his roles in blockbusters like ""Jurassic World"" (2015) and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), many of Chris Pratt's biggest fans discovered him in his role as Andy Dwyer on the beloved sitcom ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-2015). Born in Virginia, Minnesota in 1979 and raised in Lake Stevens, Washington, Pratt was active in high school wrestling. Though he exuded confidence and was known to proclaim that he would one day be rich and famous, his path to acting was circuitous. He enrolled briefly at community college and later lived for a time in his van in Maui, Hawaii. Though he participated in dinner theater, Pratt only later pursued a full time acting career upon moving to Los Angeles. He was working as a server at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in 2000 when he happened to meet Rae Dawn Chong, who cast him in her directorial debut, the short film ""Cursed Part 3"" (2000).

Pratt and Faris divorced in 2018, but Pratt soon began seeing Katherine Schwarzenegger. The pair married in 2019, the same year Pratt played Peter Quill once again in the smash hit ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019)."
Zoe Saldana,"After spending most of her youth training as a dancer, Zoe Saldana made the transition to acting on screen after an attention-getting performance in the stage musical ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."" Saldana began landing television and feature roles almost immediately, including ""Center Stage"" (2000), in which she was able to showcase her years of ballet training. Despite the fast start, her career had trouble lifting off after a series of disappointing film like ""Get Over It"" (2001) and ""Crossroads"" (2002), though she did make fleeting appearances in large studio fare like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" (2003) and ""The Terminal"" (2004). Eventually, Saldana managed to break free from the confines of broad comedy and forgettable independents when she was cast to play both Lieutenant Uhura in the highly anticipated reboot of ""Star Trek"" (2009) and its sequels, Gamora in Marvel's action comedy smash ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), and the Na'vi heroine, Neytiri, in James Cameron's box office behemoth, ""Avatar"" (2009). These blockbusters bounced the actress from relative obscurity to undeniable movie star, but she also took the time to appear in smaller-scale prestige projects such as Luc Besson's action thriller ""Colombiana"" (2011), family drama ""Infinitely Polar Bear"" (2014), and Ben Affleck's Prohibition-set drama ""Live By Night"" (2016)."

His father's profession required Pace to relocate numerous times throughout his childhood, and he spent several years in the Middle East before the family settled in Houston, Texas. There, Pace began performing with the city's esteemed Alley Theater while still a student at Klein High School, and briefly dropped out to appear more frequently in productions. After completing his school requirements in 1997, Pace was accepted to the Jullliard School's Drama Division, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.

He then segued to series regular work on ""Wonderfalls"" (Fox 2012), producer Bryan Fuller's eclectic fantasy-drama, which became a critical favorite but an immediate casualty due to low ratings. He then segued into a series of high-profile feature projects, including the James Ivory-directed ""White Countess"" (2005) and Douglas McGrath's ""Infamous"" (2006), which cast him as the doomed murderer Dick Hickok, whose crimes served as the basis for Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. Pace reunited with Fuller for another low-rated cult favorite fantasy, ""Pushing Daisies"" (ABC 2007-09), in which he played the lead role of Ned, a baker who learns he has the ability to bring the dead back to life. He returned to TV with ""Halt and Catch Fire"" (AMC 2014- ), a dramatic period piece about the rise of the personal computing industry."

Don Cheadle,"Absolutely engaging and immensely talented, actor Don Cheadle rightfully earned his reputation as one of his generation's most versatile and committed performers. After years of thankless guest appearances on TV dramas and sitcoms, Cheadle gained attention with the role of the fastidious hotel manager of ""The Golden Palace"" (CBS, 1992-93), a spin-off from the beloved sitcom, ""The Golden Girls"" (CBS, 1985-1992). The chameleon-like Cheadle broke out with an acclaimed performance in Carl Franklin's crime thriller ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" (1995) and continued the streak with remarkable work in highly-lauded films like ""Boogie Nights"" (1997) and ""Out of Sight"" (1998). He officially made Hollywood's A-list as one of Danny Ocean's crack team of con men in Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001), but it was his performance as real-life hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina in ""Hotel Rwanda"" (2004) that earned Cheadle the most effusive critical praise of his career. He played an integral role in the Oscar-winning ensemble drama ""Crash"" (2005) prior to turning in a tour de force performance in the radio DJ biopic ""Talk to Me"" (2007). In addition to the hugely successful sequels to ""Ocean's Eleven,"" the actor was frequently seen in such big-budget productions as the superhero blockbuster sequel ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and related films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016). He later returned to television as the star of the highly-regarded cable comedy ""House of Lies"" (Showtime, 2012-16) and made his feature directing debut with the impressionistic biopic ""Miles Ahead"" (2016), in which he also starred as mercurial jazz icon Miles Davis. Cheadle's ability to virtually disappear into any role kept him at the very top of Hollywood's list of ""go to"" actors."
Guy Pearce,"Having earned a considerable reputation in his native Australia through such primetime series as ""Neighbours"" (Network Ten, 1986- ) and ""Home and Away"" (Seven Network, 1988- ), actor Guy Pearce earned international attention as the bratty drag queen Adam/Felicia in ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" (1994). Catching the eye of director Curtis Hanson, Pearce went on to international stardom with his unforgettable portrayal of Lt. Edmund Exley in the critically acclaimed neo-noir, ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997). From there, he starred in both big and small features like ""A Slipping Down Life"" (1999) and ""Rules of Engagement"" (2000), before delivering one of his most memorable performances, playing an amnesiac trying to find his wife's murderer in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking ""Memento"" (2001). Following underwhelming results with two high-profile projects, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (2002) and ""The Time Machine"" (2002), Pearce earned critical kudos in smaller fare like ""The Proposition"" (2006) and ""Death Defying Acts"" (2008), in which he portrayed famed escapologist Harry Houdini. He delivered a small, but notable turn in ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009) before portraying King Edward VIII in the Oscar-winning drama ""The King's Speech"" (2010) and a playboy who seduces a mother and daughter in ""Mildred Pierce"" (HBO, 2011), which only added to the handsome actor's exceptional versatility."
Rebecca Hall,"The daughter of one of England's most acclaimed theater and television directors, actress Rebecca Hall began making her first onscreen appearances in British television while still a child. She honed her craft for the next decade in a series of award-winning performances on the international stage, before turning to films with supporting roles as willowy, tragic types in ""The Prestige"" (2006), among other high-profile projects. Hall was then thrust further into the spotlight with a co-starring role as one of two American tourists who fall for a Spanish painter in Woody Allen's sexy comedy ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" (2008). The attention she received allowed Hall a wider array of roles to choose from, though she often preferred to remain in her native England, as she did for her BAFTA-winning performance in ""Red Riding: 1974"" (Channel 4, 2009). After delivering acclaimed turns in the indie comedy ""Please Give"" (2010) and Ben Affleck's highly praised crime thriller ""The Town"" (2010), Hall undoubtedly established herself as a talented leading actress worthy of international attention, appearing in the blockbuster superhero sequel, ""Iron Man 3"" (2013)."
Jon Favreau,"Actor, producer, writer and director Jon Favreau hit unlikely pay dirt when ""Swingers"" (1996), his low-budget, autobiographical indie about struggling young actors, turned he and co-star/real-life best friend Vince Vaughn into hot property seemingly overnight. Favreau parlayed his rising profile into a number of supporting big-screen roles as cynical side men, but he was more anxious to get behind the camera and direct bigger features. After another indie buddy comedy with Vaughn, mob farce ""Made"" (2001), Favreau went wide with the holiday hit ""Elf"" (2003), starring a spandex-clad Will Ferrell. His acclaimed adaptation of the kids book ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) missed the mark with audiences, but his 2008 adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Iron Man"" starring Robert Downey, Jr. was one of the most anticipated action films of the year, leading to a return to leading man status for Downey, Jr. and hard-won blockbuster credentials for its highly creative director. Along with continuing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a producer and actor (playing Tony Stark's personal assistant Happy Hogan), Favreau found further success as a director through films as varied as the romantic comedy-drama ""Chef"" (2014) and the CGI blockbusters ""The Jungle Book"" (2016) and ""The Lion King"" (2019)."
Chris Hemsworth,"Tall, muscular and exceptionally handsome, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth became a star in the U.S. with a series of well-received genre films. He was a household name in his native country while starring on the popular drama series, ""Home and Away"" (7 Network, 1988- ), playing an opinionated student navigating his way through high school in a seaside town. He quickly became a sci-fi sensation across the pond with a brief but memorable role in the J.J. Abrams reboot of the worldwide phenomenon ""Star Trek"" (2009) as Capt. James T. Kirk's ill-fated father. But it was not until he landed the lead role in the film version of the comic book hero ""Thor"" (2011) - beating out his younger brother, fellow heartthrob Liam, in the process - that Hemsworth truly flexed his muscles, establishing himself as one of the most charismatic young actors of the moment. Lionsgate films quickly capitalized on Hemsworth's popularity by releasing the long-delayed horror feature ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012), co-written by Joss Whedon. Ironically, it was Whedon who later directed the young star in the superhero blockbuster ""The Avengers"" (2012), bringing together ""Thor"" and Marvel Studios' other franchise films. Along with his continuing screen presence as the Nordic superhero, Hemsworth expanded with range with films ranging from the thriller ""Blackhat"" (2015), Ron Howard's sailing drama ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (2015), and two fantasy films based on fairy tales, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016). As talented as he was attractive, Hemsworth was without a doubt, a leading man to watch."
Natalie Portman,"Hailed as a child prodigy for her uncommonly skilled performances in Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" (1994) and Michael Mann's ""Heat"" (1995), Natalie Portman dodged the ""child star curse"" bullet to become a major big screen draw in her twenties. Even as a teen, Portman's talent for portraying sensitive old souls reflected her own grounded, emotionally evolved persona, as well as her ability to plan her career and choose roles wisely. She offered a Golden Globe-nominated performance as the level-headed daughter of flighty single mom Susan Sarandon in ""Anywhere But Here"" (1999), before transforming into a sci-fi pin-up as regal queen Padme Amidala in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy (1999, 2002, 2005). Her occasional forays into mega blockbuster territory - including ""V for Vendetta"" (2006) and Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" (2011) - proved Portman's screen appeal as an empowered, intelligent and irresistibly cute screen star. Throughout her career Portman maintained ""acclaimed actress"" status with a Golden Globe-winning turn in Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" (2004) and Oscar-winning performance in Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" (2010), as well as work in smaller films like Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" (2004) and Ivan Reitman's romantic comedy ""No Strings Attached"" (2011), where her charm, emotional accessibility and increasing dramatic range made her one of the most bankable young women on the big screen. Along with her Oscar-nominated turn as Jackie Kennedy in the unconventional biopic ""Jackie"" (2016), her work in Terrence Malick's experimental ""Knight of Cups"" (2016), as well as her initial foray into writing and directing with the Hebrew-langauge drama ""A Tale of Love and Darkness"" (2015), proved she remained willing to take artistic risks."
Tom Hiddleston,"British actor Tom Hiddleston rose from an acclaimed stage career to international prominence with major supporting roles in a string of hit films in 2011, including ""Thor,"" Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" and Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse."" His extensive theatrical training proved essential for these larger-than-life roles, which ranged from a vengeful Norse god and a legendary novelist to a courageous but doomed World War I officer. Prior to his emergence on the international scene, Hiddleston was featured largely in supporting roles on U.K. television, but in the wake of ""Thor,"" he became an in-demand player on both sides of the Atlantic. The following year proved an even bigger jackpot, with a reprisal of his villainous ""Thor"" role in ""The Avengers"" (2012) and a starring turn as Prince Hal in PBS productions of ""Henry IV"" and ""Henry V."" More than anything else, it was his versatility and cheeky charm that minted Tom Hiddleston as certified scene stealer on the verge of worldwide stardom."
Idris Elba,"Idris Elba was a British actor who became known for playing the Baltimore drug dealer Stringer Bell on HBO's widely-acclaimed drama ""The Wire"" (HBO, 2002-08), in addition to countless other high profile television and film roles. Elba was born in Hackney, London in 1972. His parents were immigrants (his father was born in Sierra Leone, while his mother was from Ghana), and moved to London by way of Sierra Leone shortly before Elba was born. Elba grew up in East Ham and Hackney, and first got interested in acting after seeing an advertisement in a London-based entertainment publication. The advertisement was asking newbie actors to audition for a new play. Elba jumped at the opportunity, and showed up at the audition. On his first try, Elba landed the part, and would later meet his first agent while performing in the play. Performing in the play was an eye-opening experience for Elba, who decided quickly after that he wanted to be an actor. At the age of 16 he was able to land a huge break by landing a spot in the National Youth Music Theater, thanks to a grant from the Prince's Trust charitable organization. While a member of the National Youth Music Theater, Elba was able to hone his acting craft, while developing the necessary skills he needed to make it as a performer. It was also around this time that Elba began working for his uncle's wedding D.J. company and found that he absolutely loved scratching records. His love grew so strong that by his late teens Elba embarked on a career as a D.J. He would go on to play music in London nightclubs in the evening, while working a number of odd jobs by the day. In his early 20s Elba made a serious attempt at launching his acting career. In addition to working his D.J. jobs, in which he went by the name of Big Driis, he began auditioning for film and TV roles. By the mid-1990s, Elba was landing steady acting work in the U.K. He nabbed guest spots on the children's sitcom ""2point4 Children"" (BBC One, 1991-99) and the British comedy series ""Absolutely Fabulous"" (BBC Two/BBC One, 1992-2012), before landing a recurring role on the crime series ""The Ruth Rendell Mysteries"" (ITV, 1987-2000). By the late 90s and early 2000s Elba was nabbing recurring parts on a number of British television shows, including ""Insiders"" (BBC One, 1997), ""Ultraviolet"" (Channel 4, 1998), and ""Dangerfield"" (BBC One, 1995-99). Then in 2002 Elba landed his first big break across the pond when he was cast as Stringer Bell, a Baltimore-based drug kingpin, on David Simon's multi-layered crime drama series ""The Wire."" Elba played Stringer Bell for 37 episodes of the widely-acclaimed series, before his character was killed off in season 3. After playing Stringer Bell for three years, Idris Elba's acting career in both the U.K. and the United States flourished. In addition to nabbing parts in high-profile films like ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007) and ""American Gangster"" (2007), he starred as the title character in the BBC crime series ""Luther"" (BBC One, 2010 - ). He also landed a recurring role on the beloved American sitcom ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-2013) in 2009. By the early 2010s Elba's acting profile continued to grow at a rapid pace. He appeared in blockbuster films like ""Thor"" (2011), ""Prometheus"" (2012), and ""Pacific Rim"" (2013), and was also cast as Nelson Mandela in the 2013 bio pic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" (2013). In 2016 Elba was nominated for a Golden Globe for his captivating performance in the drama ""Beasts of No Nation"" (2015), and appeared in the films ""Molly's Game"" (2017) and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018). 2019 also proved to be a big year for Idris Elba. In addition to co-creating and starring in the Netflix series ""Turn Up Charlie"" (Netflix, 2019- ), a partially autobiographical show that was based on his experiences as a D.J., Elba appeared alongside The Rock and Jason Statham in the blockbuster action film ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw"" (2019). When ""Hobbs and Shaw"" was released in the summer of 2019 the film made over $700 billion, making it one of the highest grossing films of the year-just another reason why Idris Elba had certified his status as one of Hollywood's most bankable actors of the 2010s."
Christopher Eccleston,"The off-beat, yet oddly handsome, Christopher Eccleston first came to prominence as the mentally-challenged teenage accused murderer Derek Bentley in the based-on-fact ""Let Him Have It"" (1991) before going on to play an assortment of intense, deeply conflicted characters. He really achieved big screen prominence with his expert portrayals of the dour, almost psychotic accountant in the snarky thriller ""Shallow Grave"" (1994) and the titular stonemason in ""Jude"" (1996), directed by Michael Winterbottom, as well as the plotting Duke of Norfolk in the Oscar-nominated Best Picture ""Elizabeth"" (1998)."
Hayley Atwell,"Hayley Atwell possessed an air of natural elegance and grace that made her a favorite to portray strong-willed yet emotionally vulnerable women. After only a short time in the limelight in her native England, Atwell landed a starring role in Woody Allen's morality tale ""Cassandra's Dream"" (2007) as Ewan McGregor's calculating actress girlfriend. Propelled by such a high-profile role, Atwell's career gained even more momentum with starring roles in the historical films ""Brideshead Revisited"" (2008) and ""The Duchess"" (2008). But it was her breakout role as an arrogant aristocrat toppled by wartime power struggles in the epic miniseries ""The Pillars of the Earth"" (Starz Entertainment, 2010) that made Hollywood sit up and take notice of Atwell's talents, all of which paved the way for bigger and more exciting parts to follow. These included her entry into Marvel's Avengers universe as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Peggy Carter in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and its sequels, as well as her own TV series, ""Agent Carter"" (ABC 2015-16)."
Tommy Lee Jones,"Actor Tommy Lee Jones emerged to become one of the most admired and respected film stars of his generation. A start on the daytime soap ""One Life to Live"" (ABC, 1967-2012) eventually led to leading roles in made-for-television movies like ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" (CBS, 1977) and ""The Executioner's Song"" (NBC, 1982) that clearly demonstrated his acting prowess. An Emmy award win for the miniseries ""Lonesome Dove"" (CBS, 1989) raised his fortunes permanently, leading to defining film roles in ""JFK"" (1991), ""The Fugitive"" (1993) and ""Men in Black"" (1997). He played the grizzled veteran looking for redemption in below the radar fare like ""The Hunted"" (2003) and ""The Missing"" (2005), and Jones found himself the talk of Oscar buzz once again with empathetic performances in ""No Country For Old Men"" (2007) and ""In the Valley of Elah"" (2007), both of which affirmed his status as an actor able to deliver some of the most powerful and nuanced performances of recent memory."
Hugo Weaving,"Though he shied away from big Hollywood blockbusters early in his career, actor Hugo Weaving went on to have prominent supporting roles - typically as the villain - in some of the biggest movie franchises in cinema history. After emerging from his native Australia wearing drag for the international hit ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" (1994), Weaving used his powerful and distinctive voice to good use in ""Babe"" (1995) and its sequel ""Babe 2: Pig in the City"" (1998). But he came into true prominence as the ubiquitous Agent Smith in the surprise hit sci-fi thriller, ""The Matrix"" (1999), and its two sequels, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (2003). He had a smaller, but no less important role as an Elf leader in ""The Lord of the Rings"" (2001-03) trilogy. Both franchises catapulted Weaving's career and turned him into a household name. Though he routinely went back to Australia to film smaller, more dramatic-minded fare, he always seemed to find himself right in the middle of huge Hollywood pictures, including as the voice of Megatron in ""Transformers"" (2007) and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009)."
Dominic Cooper,"British actor Dominic Cooper's career was launched by his significant role in the acclaimed stage and screen versions of the period prep school drama, ""The History Boys"" (2006), in which he portrayed the cocky teen Dakin. Cooper's buzzed-about performance in the film and his origination of the role on London's West End led to a steady stream of work in BBC/PBS co-productions and supporting roles in period dramas on both the big and small screen, ranging from ""The Duchess"" (2008), to ""Sense and Sensibility"" (PBS, 2008), to the charming 1960s coming-of-age feature, ""An Education"" (2009). Cooper had bona fide blockbusters on his hands with the musical ""Mamma Mia"" (2008) and his role as Howard Stark in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) and the Marvel TV series ""Agent Carter"" (ABC 2015- ), but generally his stage-trained sensibilities were more at home in smaller, character-driven dramas."
Anthony Hopkins,"From a young age, Anthony Hopkins gravitated towards creativity and the arts. Born in 1937, he grew up in Wales, often struggling in school. As a teenager, a chance meeting with actor Richard Burton, also from Wales, inspired Hopkins to immerse himself in acting, attending drama schools with a brief two-year break serving in the British Army. Moving to London, Hopkins first took the stage in 1960. A mentorship relationship with Laurence Olivier helped fuel his young career and he made the leap from stage to screen by the late '60s. His first major role was as Richard I in ""The Lion in Winter"" (1968). While he still performed regularly in the theater, Hopkins continued to work on TV and film, following up his debut with ""War and Peace"" (BBC 1972). His most notable roles in the '70s are likely his pair of films directed by Richard Attenborough: ""Young Winston"" (1972) and the war epic ""A Bridge Too Far"" (1977). At the start of the next decade, he dazzled as Dr. Frederick Treves in David Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"" (1980). While his acting talent was apparent to all who saw him perform, Hopkins finally cracked through in a clear mainstream way with his Academy Award-winning turn as Dr. Hannibal Lector in Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). It kicked off an impressive run for the actor as he followed it up with Oscar nominations for his roles in ""The Remains of the Day"" (1993), ""Nixon"" (1995), and ""Amistad"" (1997). In the early '90s, he was prolific, additionally appearing in ""Howards End"" (1992), ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), ""Chaplin"" (1992), and ""Shadowlands"" (1993). At the turn of the century, he reprised his role as Hannibal Lector in ""Hannibal"" (2001) and ""Red Dragon"" (2002). While his '90s pace wasn't replicated in the 2000s, Hopkins was still a busy actor, dotting the next decade of his career with starring roles in films such as ""The World's Fastest Indian"" (2005) and ""Fracture"" (2007), in addition to appearances in ""Alexander"" (2004) and ""The Wolfman"" (2010). In 2011, he appeared as Odin in the Marvel film ""Thor"" (2011), a part which he'd reprise several times in the next decade. Hopkins also starred in the sci-fi adaptation of ""Westworld"" (HBO 2016- ). He also received much acclaim for his performances in ""King Lear"" (BBC 2018) and ""The Two Popes"" (2019)."
Sam Rockwell,"Sam Rockwell was an Academy Award-winning film actor who was best known for his critically acclaimed roles in films like ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (2002), ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017), and ""Vice"" (2018). Born in Daly City, California, Rockwell grew up primarily in San Francisco. His parents, who were both struggling actors in their own right, divorced when he was 5. As a boy, Sam would spend summers in New York with his mom and live with his dad in California during the school year. While attending high school in San Francisco, Rockwell nabbed a small part in an independent film. From there he was hooked, and after graduation he packed his bags and headed east to New York to make it as an actor. To pay his bills while he pursued acting in the Big Apple, Rockwell took a series of odd jobs, including restaurant busboy and private investigator's assistant. All the while he was landing small roles in films like ""Strictly Business"" (1991), ""Light Sleeper"" (1992), and ""Jack and His Friends"" (1992). Then in 1994 Rockwell appeared in a nationwide beer commercial and was financially secure enough to pursue acting fulltime. He continued making a name for himself with big parts in smaller films like ""Box of Moonlight"" (1996) and ""The Call Back"" (1998), as well as small parts in big films like ""The Green Mile"" (1999) and ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000). Then in 2002 Rockwell nabbed his breakout role playing Chuck Barris, host of ""The Gong Show,"" in the George Clooney-directed dark comedy ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (2002). Rockwell's performance earned widespread praise, and before long he was appearing in bigger studio films like ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007), ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008), and ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). By the late 2010s, after over two decades in the business, Rockwell was finally beginning to receive recognition from the Academy for his work. He won his first Oscar in 2018 for his supporting role in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,"" and the following year, in 2019, was nominated for an acting Oscar for a second time for his part as President George W. Bush in the Adam McKay-directed Dick Cheney biopic ""Vice"" (2018)."
Mickey Rourke,"Emerging onto the film landscape loaded with talent and promise, actor Mickey Rourke first made his presence known with a scene-stealing turn as an arsonist in the erotic noir ""Body Heat"" (1981) before spending the next few years playing roles that would be looked back upon as the genesis of his greatness. His performances in ""Diner"" (1982) and ""Rumble Fish"" (1983) were clear signs that the world was witnessing the emergence of another James Dean or Robert De Niro. After several quiet years, Rourke reemerged in several small but prominent turns, culminating in a full-fledged career comeback with his acclaimed performances in ""Sin City"" (2005) and ""The Wrestler"" (2008). Thanks to his resurgence, Rourke was able to secure roles in blockbusters like ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and ""The Expendables"" (2010), which helped rekindle his long-burning promise."
Terrence Howard,"Terrence Howard was an Oscar-nominated actor who was best known for his roles in films like ""Hustle & Flow"" (2005) and ""Iron Man"" (2008), as well as his starring role on the Fox hip hop drama series ""Empire"" (Fox, 2015- ). Born in Chicago and raised in Cleveland, Howard grew up in a somewhat troubled household. His father was physically abusive and when Terrence was two his dad was convicted of manslaughter for stabbing a man after he cut in line to see Santa Claus at a Cleveland Department Store. His father would go on to serve 11 months in prison. Howard's parents divorced shortly after his father arrived home from prison so young Terrence would spend much of his time being raised by his great grandmother. Howard's great grandmother just happened to be a respected New York stage actress by the name of Minnie Gentry, who introduced Howard to acting when he was a young boy. As it would happen, Howard would later go on to be discovered by a casting agent while walking the streets of New York, thus setting his fledgling acting career into motion. Howard nabbed his first major role in 1992 when he played Jackie Jackson on the ABC miniseries ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"" (ABC, 1992). From there he would go on to appear in guest spots on shows like ""Living Single"" (Fox, 1993-98), ""Coach"" (ABC, 1989-1997), and ""Family Matters"" (ABC, 1989-1998). Then in 1995 Howard nabbed his first big break when he appeared in the Oscar-nominated film ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" (1995). Howard continued nabbing film roles over the next several years, most notably ""The Best Man"" (1999), ""Hart's War"" (2002), and ""Crash"" (2004). In 2005 Howard played an aspiring rap star in the music drama ""Hustle & Flow."" The film was widely acclaimed and earned Howard his first Oscar nod. Howard's next big role came in 2008 when he played Rhodey in the superhero film ""Iron Man."" Howard continued appearing in films over the next several years, before returning to television in 2015 as the star of the Fox hip hop drama ""Empire."" The series was a hit with audiences, and even further cemented Howard's status as one of the most versatile actors of his generation. The sixth season of ""Empire"" premiered in September of 2019, with Howard reprising his role as Luscious Lyon."
Jeff Bridges,"Though acclaimed veteran actor Jeff Bridges was born into a Hollywood family, he proved his own merit as a star several times over. The son of actors Lloyd and Dorothy Bridges, Bridges was born in Los Angeles in 1949. As children, he and his brother Beau occasionally appeared in small roles on their father's TV series ""Sea Hunt"" (CBS, 1958-1961) and ""The Lloyd Bridges Show"" (CBS, 1962-63), and by age 17, he was touring with his father in a production of ""Anniversary Waltz."" When the tour wrapped, Bridges struck out on his own, studying acting at the Herbert Bergdorf Studio before beginning to actively pursue film roles. He also enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve, serving from 1967 to 1975. Bridges made guest appearances on shows like ""Lassie"" (CBS, 1954-1974) before landing his breakout role as Duane Jackson in Peter Bogdonovich's acclaimed film ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971), for which he earned his first Oscar nomination. Soon, he was taking direction from legendary filmmaker John Huston with a prominent supporting role in the boxing film ""Fat City"" (1972). Bridges next starred as a NASCAR driver in in ""The Last American Hero"" (1973) before earning yet another Oscar nod for his performance alongside Clint Eastwood in the crime comedy ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" (1974). In 1975, Bridges appeared in a contemporary Western called ""Rancho Deluxe"" (1975) and while filming the movie in Montana, met a waitress named Susan Geston, whom he married later that year. The couple would maintain a home in Montana despite Bridges' demands in Hollywood for decades to come. Less than a year after his wedding, Bridges starred in the blockbuster remake of ""King Kong"" (1976), cementing his place in Hollywood as a major star. As the '80s began, he starred in the groundbreaking science fiction adventure ""TRON"" (1982) and later earned his third Academy Award nomination for his performance in the sci-fi drama ""Starman"" (1984). As the decade progressed, he would make waves in films like  ""Against All Odds"" (1984), ""Jagged Edge"" (1985), and ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" (1989). By the '90s, Bridges was long established as both a bankable movie star and a true actor's actor.  He worked with the respected director Peter Weir in the drama ""Fearless"" (1993) and starred as legendary cowboy Wild Bill Hickok in the aptly titled ""Wild Bill"" (1995). But perhaps one of Bridges' most iconic roles came in 1998 when he played Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski in the Coen Brothers' film ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998). Bridges' performance as the lackadaisical character struck a huge chord with audiences and quickly became an enduring classic. He continued to find compelling roles in the following decade, earning another Academy Award nomination for his role in the political drama ""The Contender"" (2001) and reteaming with Terry Gilliam for the hallucinatory drama ""Tideland"" (2005). Bridges joined the Marvel universe as villain Obadiah Stane in ""Iron Man"" (2008) and finally won an Oscar in 2010 for his critically acclaimed performance as a troubled country musician in ""Crazy Heart"" (2010). The following year found Bridges working with the Coen brothers again, this time playing Rooster Cogburn in a lauded remake of the Western ""True Grit"" (2011) that earned him still another Oscar nomination. He won similar accolades for his performance as a Texas Ranger in the neo-Western ""Hell or High Water"" (2016)-the basis for his seventh Oscar nod. Bridges went on to join the ""Kingsmen"" action franchise with a role in ""Kingsmen: The Golden Circle"" (2018) and memorably appeared in the ensemble thriller ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" (2018)."
Shaun Toub,"Shaun Toub had a globe-trotting and colorful life long before he got anywhere near a Hollywood film set. Hailing from Tehran, Iran, his family escaped around the time of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. They settled first in England, then Toub lived for a few years in Switzerland before moving the United States, eventually ending up as a student at USC. From there, it was a short hop into the entertainment world as an actor, and another short hop before the cameras of big-budget Hollywood movies and popular TV series. He first appeared in a small role in the crime drama ""Hunter"" (1988), and from there worked steadily in the medium. Among many other shows, Toub took guest roles in ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" (1993) as Asabi, and in ""Seinfeld"" (1997), playing Indian newlywed Pinter Ranawat. Toub made even more of a splash in movies, in a string of popular releases. He stayed close to his roots playing Persian would-be gun owner Farhad in Paul Haggis's ensemble drama, ""Crash"" (2004), and strayed from them to portray a pivotal role as the captive Afghan, Dr. Yinsen, in 2008's hugely successful ""Iron Man."" Two years later, the actor continued in the big-budget comic adaptation sphere with an appearance as Uncle Iroh in ""The Last Airbender"" (2010)."
Faran Tahir,"Although born in Los Angeles, CA, while his parents studied acting and directing at UCLA, Faran Tahir spent most of his childhood in Pakistan. Following in his parents' footsteps he returned to America in 1980 where he attended the University of California at Berkeley, graduating with a BA in Theatre followed by a graduate degree from the Institute for Advanced Theatre Training at Harvard University. A successful theatre actor, he made his film debut in Disney's live action adaptation of ""Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book"" (1994) before landing a lead role in indie drama ""ABCD"" (1999). He gained a cult following when he co-starred in superhero blockbuster ""Iron Man"" (2008) as one of the villains who takes Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) hostage and sets him on the road to becoming the armored avenger. His sci-fi credentials were strengthened by two JJ Abrams collaborations with a guest spot in ""Lost"" (ABC 2004-2010), then a small but pivotal role in 2009's ""Star Trek"" reboot as Federation Captain Richard Robau. A recurring role in cult series ""Warehouse 13"" (Syfy 2009-2014) and an appearance in ""Supernatural"" (WB/CW, 2005-) as Egyptian god Osiris helped seal his fantasy fanbase. However, Tahir opted for something very different in 2012 when he played 'Smiling' Frank Ashkani, Cliff Barnes' (Ken Kercheval) advisor and driver, in eight episodes of the re-launched night time soap ""Dallas"" (TNT 2012-). He returned to genre cinema with a key role in the Matt Damon-starring fantasy thriller ""Elysium"" (2013)."
Michelle Williams,"After enjoying initial stardom on the angst-fueled teen series ""Dawson's Creek"" (The WB, 1998-2003), Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning actress Michelle Williams essayed complex, multi-faceted women in such critical and popular hits as ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), ""Blue Valentine"" (2010), ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016) and ""Fosse/Verdon"" (FX, 2019). Born Michelle Ingrid Williams in Kalispell, Montana on September 9, 1980, she relocated with her younger sister and three paternal half-siblings to San Diego, California when she was nine years of age. There, she became interested in acting after seeing a stage version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and began appearing in local theater productions. In her teenaged years, Williams began traveling to Los Angeles to audition for film and television roles, and made her screen debut as a seductive teenager in a 1993 episode of ""Baywatch"" (NBC/syndicated, 1989-2001). Appearances in features like ""Lassie"" (1994) and ""Species"" (1995) preceded her breakout role on ""Dawson's Creek."" Williams played Jen Lindley, the most visibly troubled member of the series' quartet of self-analyzing teens; though a ratings hit and a launching board for Williams's appearances in teen-oriented features like ""Halloween: H20"" (1998) and ""Dick"" (1999), she longed for more substantive work, and found it between seasons in the Off-Broadway production of Tracy Letts's Killer Joe and the HBO feature ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" (2000), which cast her and Chloe Sevigny as young gay women in a relationship. When ""Creek"" ended in 2003, Williams continued to seek out challenging fare: she was a young woman embroiled in a destructive relationship with friend Anna Friel in ""Me Without You"" (2001), and a small-town librarian involved with reclusive Peter Dinklage in ""The Station Agent"" (2003) before scoring a personal and professional triumph with Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005). Cast as Heath Ledger's long-suffering wife, she earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, while also forging a romantic relationship with Ledger that resulted in the birth of a daughter in 2005. Their union ran aground in 2007, one year before Ledger's tragic death from a prescription overdose; Williams found solace in her work, which included Todd Haynes's film about Bob Dylan, ""I'm Not There"" (2007) and Charlie Kaufman's unique ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008), as well as a near-solo turn as a homeless woman in ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008). She capped this string of indies with a potent turn as a woman who committed infanticide in Martin Scorsese's supernatural thriller ""Shutter Island"" (2010) and as a woman in a troubled marriage to Ryan Gosling in Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine"" (2010), the latter of which earned her a second Oscar nomination. A third Academy nod would come the following year with her turn as Marilyn Monroe in ""My Week with Marilyn"" (2011), which Williams followed with a diverse collection of projects, from Sarah Polley's mature romance ""Take This Waltz"" (2011) to Sam Raimi's ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" (2012), which cast her as Glinda the Good Witch. The latter was chosen to appeal to her daughter, Mathilde Rose, and Williams' desire to provide a more constant presence in her life led to stage work that culminated in a 2014 Broadway run as Sally Bowles in Cabaret and a 2016 Tony nomination for Blackbird. She returned to films in 2016 as Casey Affleck's estranged wife in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea,"" which netted a fourth Oscar nomination. Its critical success spurred a flurry of activity by Williams, who moved swiftly from the lavish musical ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017) to Ridley Scott's troubled drama ""All the Money in the World"" (2018), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination as the mother of kidnapping victim J. Paul Getty. A rare foray into big-budget genre films came with ""Venom"" (2018), an adaptation of the Marvel Comics series with Tom Hardy, provided her with the highest-grossing film of her career, which she followed with an English-language remake of ""After the Wedding"" (2019). Williams then returned to television for the first time since ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" for ""Fosse/Verdon,"" a miniseries based on the tumultuous lives and careers of choreographer and filmmaker Bob Fosse (played by Sam Rockwell) and dancer Gwen Verdon. As Verdon, Williams won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series. While filming, Williams began dating director Thomas Kail;it was announced in December 2019 that the couple had gotten engaged and that Williams was pregnant with her second child."
Riz Ahmed,"British Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed is political, passionate and undeniably talented. The native Londoner first roamed the posh halls of Oxford as a student of philosophy and politics before training at the University of London's Central School of Speech and Drama. Under the alias Riz MC, he released the satirical rap single ""Post 9/11 Blues"" in 2006, the same year he made his film debut as Guantanamo Bay detainee Shafiq Rasul in ""The Road to Guantanamo."" Keenly aware of his Pakistani heritage, Ahmed nevertheless sought out a diverse array of roles. He played the title drug dealer in ""Shifty"" (2008); a wanna-be suicide bomber in the terrorist satire ""Four Lions"" (2010); and a complex, controlling hotelier in ""Trishna"" (2011). But Ahmed wasn't content confining his creativity to just the screen. He parlayed ""Post 9/11 Blues"" into a successful career as Riz MC, which saw him honored as a BBC Introducing artist four years before the release of his 2011 album, MICroscope. His portrayal of a tough council estate drug dealer in ""Ill Manors"" (2012) capped off a string of roles that found the intelligent, articulate actor bring his explosive talent to new heights."
Scott Haze,"Actor and filmmaker Scott Haze emerged from the Los Angeles theater scene to deliver intense, harrowing performances in such uncompromising films as ""As I Lay Dying"" (2013) and ""Child of God"" (2014) for his friend and frequent collaborator, James Franco. Born in Dallas, Texas, Haze trained at both the Stella Adler Conservatory and Playhouse West and began his screen acting career in 2004 with minor roles in various short and independent films. He also founded and built the Sherry Theater in North Hollywood, California, where he produced a number of dramatic plays, included several of his own works. In 2011, he created the comedy series ""The Vanya Show"" (YouTube, 2011- ), about a self-obsessed Russian actress intent on making her name in Hollywood. During this period, Haze forged a close personal and professional relationship with actor-director James Franco, who would cast him in several of his most ambitious film projects, including adaptations of William's Faulkner's ""As I Lay Dying"" and ""The Sound and the Fury"" (2014). Haze drew widespread critical acclaim for his performance in ""Child of God"" (2013), Franco's adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name about a feral young man (Haze) at odds with society. His wholly committed turn in a difficult role earned him a spot on Variety's 10 Actors to Watch list that year, and was soon followed by supporting turns in Jeff Nichols' science fiction thriller ""Midnight Special"" (2014) and a variety of projects with Franco. These included ""Making a Scene with James Franco"" (AOL, 2014- ), in which filmmakers provide their own take on famous movie scenes by blending them with other genres and styles. Haze also honed his own career as a filmmaker, most notably with the documentaries ""Ghosts & Goblins"" (2015), about the celebrated amateur wrestler Leroy Kemp, and ""Mulli"" (2015), which concerned the Reverend Charles Mulli and his humanitarian efforts in Africa."
Reid Scott,"In the early years of the millennium, Reid Scott established himself as the boyishly handsome everyguy du jour in a succession of mostly comedic TV outings. A native of Upstate New York, Scott traveled the well-worn path to New York, doing both theater and soaps before eventually relocating to Los Angeles, where he found a national audience on the short-lived, gay-meets-straight culture-clash outing ""It's All Relative"" (ABC, 2003-04). Though that stint did not last a full season, he made a more lasting imprint in the ensemble cast of the critically adored TBS original comedy series, ""My Boys"" (2006-2010). In 2010, he popped up again on the edgy cable comedy, ""The Big C"" (HBO, 2010-13), playing the oncologist on the bold comedy tracking a woman's battle with cancer. Wielding a preternaturally disarming smile and affable demeanor, Scott carved a niche as an actor with both matinee idol charms and boy-next-door accessibility."
Jenny Slate,"Jenny Slate was an actress who had a successful Hollywood career. In 2000, she formed comedy duo Gabe & Jenny with Gabe Liedmann . In 2011, she made big-screen debut in ""Alvin & The Chipmunks: Chipwrecked"" . In 2005, she made TV debut in an uncredited role on ""Starved."" In 2008, she appeared on an episode of ""The Whitest Kids U'Know."" In 2012, she voiced Ted's Mom in ""The Lorax.""

Tom Cruise,"Tom Cruise rose quickly to become one of the best-known American actors in the world. Born in Syracuse, New York, he moved around throughout his childhood, including a period in Canada. After graduating from high school in New Jersey, he moved first to New York and then to Los Angeles to pursue acting. He made his film debut in the Brooke Shields vehicle ""Endless Love"" (1981). His next role as an aggressive military cadet opposite Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn in ""Taps"" (1981) caught people's attention. He joined another group of young stars, including Patrick Swayze and Rob Lowe, in Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of the S.E. Hinton novel ""The Outsiders"" (1983). His starring role as schoolboy-turned-pimp Joel in ""Risky Business"" broke him as one of Hollywood's newest celebrities. The long shoot schedule of Ridley Scott's fantasy epic ""Legend"" (1985) briefly took him out of the public eye, but he bounced back with one of the iconic roles of the 1980s. Playing Navy fighter pilot Maverick in Tony Scott's ""Top Gun"" (1986) turned Cruise into a superstar. He began branching into roles with more heft at the same time when he joined Paul Newman for ""The Color of Money"" (1986). He continued in that vein during the next several years, working with high profile directors and co-stars in prestige projects. He partnered with Dustin Hoffman for ""Rain Man"" (1988), Oliver Stone for ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989), and Jack Nicholson for ""A Few Good Men"" (1993), the first two of which were Oscar-winners for Best Picture. The actor picked up his first Academy Award nomination for ""Born on the Fourth of July."" While it didn't garner the same level of critical acclaim, his role as Anne Rice's vampire Lestat opposite a young Brad Pitt in ""Interview with a Vampire"" (1994) became as well-remembered as any of the actor's roles. His 11-year marriage to Nicole Kidman saw the couple partner on three films including Ron Howard's ""Far and Away"" (1992) and Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999). By the '90s, he had his pick of roles and began mixing in big-budget populist fare like ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), based on the '60s television show of the same name. His role as secret agent Ethan Hunt proved popular enough for a series of sequels that would extend for more than two decades. Cruise also notched a second Oscar nomination for his role as a sports agent gaining a conscious in Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996). He worked with another rising filmmaker when he played motivational speaker Frank Mackey in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" (1999), a role that earned him another Academy Award nomination. After the turn of the century, Cruise bounced between effects-heavy fare like ""Minority Report"" (2002) and ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) to dramas such as ""Lions for Lambs"" (2007) with Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. He also proved himself willing to puncture his own inflated image, with comedic cameos in ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" (2002) and ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), and his musical turn in ""Rock of Ages"" (2012). He similarly adopted a self-effacing posture when fans began noticing that there was a scene of the actor running in nearly all his films. Over the years, he found himself a magnet for the tabloids thanks to his close ties to the Church of Scientology and his celebrity marriages to Kidman and Katie Holmes. Cruise added another action franchise to his resume when he jumped into the role of Lee Child's literary tough guy ""Jack Reacher"" (2012). He would reprise the role in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016). After starring in the big-budget reboot of ""The Mummy"" (2017) and the drama ""American Made"" (2017), he returned to the role that once cemented his superstar status. More than 20 years after the original, Cruise climbed back into the cockpit to revive Maverick for a sequel to his 1986 hit ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2020)."
Henry Cavill,"British actor Henry Cavill rose to fame in 2013 as the screen incarnation of Superman in ""Man of Steel,"" and reprised the character on several occasions while also providing brawn and gravitas for such hits as ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (2015) and ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018). Born Henry William Dalgliesh Cavill on May 5, 1983 on Jersey, the largest of England's Channel Islands, he began his education at St. Michael's Preparatory School on Jersey before crossing the Channel to attend the Stowe School, a private boarding school near the town of Buckingham, England. He was initially drawn to ancient history, which he hoped to study at university through an armed services scholarship. But a chance encounter with Russell Crowe, who filmed ""Proof of Life"" (2000) at the school, inspired Cavill to turn his interests toward acting, which he pursued through school productions. By chance, a casting director visited Stowe in search of a young actor to play Guy Pearce's son in Kevin Reynolds' version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (2002), and chose Cavill for his looks and relative acting experience. Roles in high-profile British films, including ""I Capture the Castle"" (2003), followed, but within a few years, these had given way to low-budget or largely unseen projects, like Reynolds' ""Tristan and Isolde"" (2006). Cavill had also earned a reputation for missing out on major projects, including two that went to Robert Pattinson - ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005) and ""Twilight"" (2008) - as well as James Bond in ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and ironically, Superman in what would become ""Superman Returns"" (2006). He busied himself instead with supporting turns in Woody Allen's ""Whatever Works"" (2009) and a recurring role as the first Duke of Suffolk on Showtime's historical drama series ""The Tudors"" (BBC Two/CBC Television, 2007-2010). A turn as the mythological hero Theseus in Tarsem Singh's ""Immortals"" (2011) reconfirmed Cavill's knack for physical roles, which in turn put him back in the spotlight for the Superman film franchise. He assumed the cape for Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" (2013) - with his acting inspiration Russell Crowe as Superman's birth father, Jor-El - and reprised the D.C. Comics hero in two more films, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016), with Ben Affleck as the Caped Crusader, and ""Justice League"" (2017), which added Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Between these special effects-fueled epics, Cavill played '60s TV super-spy Napoleon Solo in a big-screen adaptation of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" and played a double-crossing agent opposite Tom Cruise in the blockbuster hit ""Mission Impossible - Fallout."" With an array of hits now under his belt, Cavill divided his time between television, playing a monster hunter in the Netflix fantasy series ""The Witcher"" (2019- ) before moving on to another enduring pop culture figure - Sherlock Holmes - in ""Enola Holmes"" with Millie Bobby Brown of ""Stranger Things"" (Netflix, 2016- ) as the consulting detective's younger and equally talented sister."
Ving Rhames,"While actor Ving Rhames won a Golden Globe Award for his starring role as the infamous boxing promoter in ""Don King: Only in America"" (HBO, 1997), he was generally known as a supporting player on the big screen. Rhames' breakout role as crime kingpin Marsellus Wallace in Quentin Tarantino's unexpected cult hit, ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), brought the actor his first major attention, while independent film fans had a taste of his imposing physicality and brooding air in earlier films, including ""The Saint of Fort Washington"" (1993) and David Mamet's ""Homicide"" (1991).  The actor went on to enjoy a steady screen career and continuous acclaim for his multi-dimensional sidekicks, supporting Tom Cruise in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise (1996, 2000, 2006), and giving strong performances in films like ""Out of Sight"" (1998) and ""Con Air"" (1997), where, among his strengths, was lending a philosophical bent to career criminals and imbuing figures of authority with realistic flaws."
Simon Pegg,"British actor, writer and comedian Simon Pegg rose to fame in the United Kingdom as the star of the popular twenty-something slacker sitcom ""Spaced"" (Channel 4, 1999, 2001). Pegg frequently collaborated with other talent from the series, forming a hip new clique of British comedians who eventually found widespread appeal with international audiences. He co-wrote and starred in the adored cult zombie spoof ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), earning a following in the United States that ballooned to full-blown stardom in 2007 with the action-flick send-up, ""Hot Fuzz."" Adding further luster to his cool-factor, Pegg was cast as chief engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott in J.J. Abrams' retelling of the ""Star Trek"" (2009) film franchise, assuring Pegg's jump to celebrity status."
Rebecca Ferguson,"Swedish-English actress Rebecca Ferguson's compelling turn as an English Queen in training in ""The White Queen"" (BBC, 2013) helped to mint her as a star in Hollywood features, including ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" (2015), ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016), ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017) and ""Men in Black: International"" (2019). Born Rebecca Louisa Ferguson Sundström on October 19, 1983 in Stockholm, Sweden, she was raised in a bilingual household - her mother was English and her father was Swedish - in the city's Vasastan district. Ferguson began her career in front of cameras in her early teens, first as a model for print publications and later, in television commercials for cosmetics and fashion accessories. After graduating from Adolf Fredrik's Music School in 1999, the 16-year-old Ferguson earned her breakout role as an upper-class teenager on the soap opera ""Nya tider"" (TV, 1999-2006). She left the series after a year and joined the cast of another soap, a Swedish-American series filmed in the United States called ""Ocean Ave.""(TV4, 2002-2003), which received poor reviews; Ferguson then retreated to the coastal town of Simirishamn, where she gave birth to a son with then-boyfriend Ludwig Hallberg in 2007. She remained largely off-screen until 2011, when director Richard Hobert spotted her at the town's market and asked her to appear in his upcoming film, ""A One-Way Trip to Antibes"" (2011). Ferguson was cast as Maria, a duplicitous maid who is blackmailed by elderly widower Sven-Bertil Taube into foiling his children's plan to steal his life savings. She soon returned to steady work on screen, first in Scandinavian features like the drama ""Us"" (2013), and then in English-language projects, beginning in 2013 with ""The White Queen,"" which cast her as commoner turned 15th-century English Queen consort Elizabeth Woodville. Her performance earned a Golden Globe nomination and led to more projects in the UK and United States, though none more high-profile than ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,"" for which she starred as Ilsa Faust, an icy operative connected to a criminal organization. Star Tom Cruise chose Ferguson for the role based on her performance in ""The White Queen,"" and the global success of the film led to starring roles in the spy thriller ""Despite the Falling Snow"" (2016), as Hugh Grant's mistress in the comic biopic ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" (2016), as Justin Theroux's wife and one of several objects of unhealthy fixation by Emily Blunt in ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016), and as a doomed scientist in the 2017 science fiction thriller ""Life"" (2017). Ferguson's run of roles in major features continued unabated in the years that followed: she played singer Jenny Lind in the musical ""The Greatest Showman"" and reprised her turn as Ilsa Faust in ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018), while also lining up prominent roles in ""Men in Black: International,"" ""Doctor Sleep"" (2020) - the sequel to Stephen King's ""The Shining"" - and Denis Villeneuve's epic adaptation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" (2020)."
Sean Harris,"Nervy, sharp-featured Londoner Sean Harris brings a feral intensity to his roles, and he has consequently come to specialize in outsiders, ranging from the hellishly violent to the merely twitchy. Raised in Norfolk and trained at London's Drama Centre, Harris appeared as Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis in Michael Winterbottom's much-admired chronicle of the Manchester music scene, ""24 Hour Party People."" In 2004's ""Creep,"" he played a monster living in the London Underground. As if that wasn't dark enough, he embodied a real-life monster, Moors murderer Ian Brady, in the BAFTA-winning TV serial ""See No Evil: The Moors Murders,"" and played a violent former football hooligan involved in a campaign of vigilante violence in Nick Love's underground hit ""Outlaw."" Harris is a regular presence in uncommercial but critically lauded British films, such as the surreal mockumentary ""Brothers of the Head,"" David Mackenzie's dark drama ""Asylum,"" and the oddball thriller ""Saxon,"" in which he played a rare lead role. He played the key role of murder victim Fred Hale in Rowan Joffe's ""Brighton Rock,"" worked with Sir Michael Caine on ""Harry Brown,"" and appears amid a starry cast in Ridley Scott's sci-fi epic ""Prometheus/b. Further TV work includes the Channel 4 serial killer drama ""Red Riding,"" and Neil Jordan's ""The Borgias."""
Jeremy Renner,"After years of struggle, actor Jeremy Renner earned a reputation as a reliable lead in dark-themed dramas, thanks initially to his stellar portrayal of infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in the biopic, ""Dahmer"" (2002). With no qualms about taking a turn to the dark side, Renner added to his esteem with acclaimed indie turns as a white supremacist in ""Neo Ned"" (2005) and a sexist boss in ""North Country"" (2005). He tackled more complex roles with sterling performances as a former L.A.P.D. cop in ""S.W.A.T."" (2003) and as the intimidating Wood Hite, cousin to Frank and Jesse James, in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007). Though a recognizable face, Renner finally broke through as a household name following his critically lauded turn as an on-edge bomb disposal expert operating in the Oscar-winning Iraq War thriller, ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009). From there, he earned himself an Oscar nomination with a finely tuned turn as a career criminal in Ben Affleck's widely hailed crime drama, ""The Town"" (2010), which soon led to roles in blockbuster movies like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), ""The Avengers"" (2011) and ""The Bourne Legacy"" (2012). With each critical nod, Renner secured a firmer footing in Hollywood as a recognizable and dependable face in a variety of feature films."
Paula Patton,"A virtual unknown when she starred as a sultry club singer opposite Andre Benjamin in the period musical ""Idlewild"" (2006), Paula Patton rose through the Hollywood ranks in a startlingly short period of time. In a matter of months she was paired onscreen with major stars Kevin Costner and Denzel Washington in both dramas and comedies. Patton's debut as a femme fatale, however, was not indicative of the types of roles the African-American actress became known for, and, in notable films like ""Precious"" (2009), she became known for portraying independent, smart professional women."
Michael Nyqvist,"Primarily known to American audiences for playing the plucky investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist in the film adaptations of author Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium Trilogy"" crime novels, Michael Nyqvist was already a huge star in Sweden prior to achieving international acclaim in the States. After landing numerous small roles in Swedish television shows throughout the '90s, Nyqvist drew praise for his role as detective John Banck on the popular crime series, ""Beck"" (1997- ). His sterling performance on the series soon led to meatier film roles, including a breakout performance in the 2000 Swedish drama, ""Together."" The film was a hit in Sweden, but it would be another four years before Nyqvist's acting work would reach acclaim on a worldwide scale. That came in 2004 when he portrayed a chronically ill conductor in ""As It Is In Heaven."" The Academy Award-nominated film thrust Nyqvist into the international spotlight, and over the next several years he continued to expand his fan base in America with riveting performances in such big budget action thrillers as ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" and ""Abduction"" - both of which were released in 2011. Born in Stockholm in 1960, Michael Nyqvist spent the early days of his youth living a relatively normal life. When he was still a toddler, however, the people he assumed to be his parents informed Nyqvist that he was adopted. His birth parents gave him up shortly after his birth, and for a brief period Nyqvist resided in an orphanage. The thought of knowing he was given up at birth haunted Nyqvist for most of his adult life, yet not enough to deter him from pursuing his love of acting. Nyqvist took his very first acting classes while living in Omaha, NE as a foreign exchange student. It was there that the young actor learned to harness the emotional trauma from his past and use it in his performances. Upon returning to Sweden, however, Nyqvist briefly took up ballet before quitting to pursue acting full time. He began landing small roles in Swedish television shows and made-for-TV movies throughout the early '90s, before landing his first big break in 1997 after being cast as the lead on the television series ""Beck."" Nyqvist played detective John Banck on seven episodes of the popular Swedish cop show, all the while becoming a household name in his native country. Although he had appeared in features before, it was Nyqvist's performance as an emotionally troubled husband in the 2000 drama ""Together"" that made him a bona fide film star in Sweden. The film was an international hit, and earned Nyqvist a Best Actor nomination at the 2001 Guldbagge Awards, Sweden's version of the Oscars. Nyqvist earned another Guldbagge Award nomination for his performance in 2004's ""As It Is In Heaven."" That film went on to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film at the 2005 Academy Awards, thus further establishing Nyqvist's already growing status as one of the most important film actors to come out of Sweden in generations. Upon appearing as the cunning magazine journalist Mikael Blomkvist in 2009's ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" Nyqvist skillfully brought to life one of the most revered characters in modern crime fiction. Nyqvist reprised his role as Blomkvist in the final two film adaptations of the ""Millennium Trilogy,"" before appearing as the villain in two Hollywood action thrillers in 2011: ""Abduction"" and ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol."" In 2013 Nyqvist appeared as a series regular on the mystery series, ""Zero Hour"" (ABC, 2013). The show, however, was cancelled after three episodes due to low ratings. Nyqvist continued working streadily on both sides of the Atlantic, moving easily from musical drama ""The Girl from Nagasaki"" (2013) and indie drama ""Days and Nights"" (2013) to big-budget thriller ""John Wick"" (2014). Well-received roles in romantic comedy ""Paris Follies"" (2014), historical thriller ""Colonia"" (2015) and love triangle story ""Frank and Lola"" (2016) followed, as did a key supporting part in historical miniseries ""Madiba"" (BET 2017). Michael Nyqvist died of lung cancer on June 27, 2017. He was 56."
Vladimir Mashkov,"Vladimir Mashkov was a prolific actor who created a name for himself largely on the big screen. Mashkov began his acting career by debuting in films like ""Limita""  (1994) with Vladimir Mashkov and Yevgeny Mironov, the Alison Uitbeck film ""American Daughter""  (1995) and the Vladimir Mashkov film ""The Thief""  (1998). He worked in series television while getting his start in acting, including a part on ""Alias""  (ABC, 2001-06). His passion for acting continued to his roles in projects like the Charlotte Ayanna drama ""Dancing At the Blue Iguana""  (2001), ""Russki Bunt""  (2001) and ""The Quickie""  (2001). He also appeared in ""Tycoon: A New Russian""  (2003) and ""Okhota Na Piranyu""  (2006). Film continued to be his passion as he played roles in ""Piter-FM""  (2006), ""The Ghost""  (2008) and ""Kandagar""  (2010). He also appeared in ""The Edge""  (2010) and the Tom Cruise smash hit action picture ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol""  (2011). Most recently, Mashkov acted in the drama ""Rasputin""  (2013) with Fanny Ardant."
Eddie Redmayne,"Actor Eddie Redmayne was born in the Westminster neighborhood of London. He began his career on the London stage, appearing in a number of productions in West End theatre before he made the leap to film. His first film was the 2006 movie ""The Good Shepherd,"" directed by Robert DeNiro and starring Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon. The next year he appeared in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"", and the movie ""Savage Grace."" In 2008 Redmayne appeared opposite Natalie Portman in ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" In 2011 Redmayne appeared in the movie ""My Week with Marilyn,"" opposite Michelle Williams. Redmayne was cast as Marius Pontmercy in the 2012 film adaptation of ""Les Miserables."" In 2014 Redmayne received significant critical acclaim for his role in the movie ""The Theory of Everything,"" in which he portrayed physicist Stephen Hawking. The following year, Redmayne appeared in the box office and critical flop ""Jupiter Ascending,"" in 2015.  Redmayne starred in Tom Hooper's ""The Danish Girl,"" the true story of a transgender woman living in the 19th century.  Redmayne's casting as a trans woman was controversial particularly in the trans community where actors felt that a representative of the population should have been cast. Despite the backlash, the movie was praised widely and Redmayne Received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Redmayne married Nahhah Bagshawe and the couple gave birth to their first child, a girl, in 2018."
Katherine Waterston,"A fearless presence in independent features since the mid-2000s, Katherine Waterston earned critical praise for her portrayal of strong-willed young women in ""Babysitters"" (2008) and ""Inherent Vice"" (2014). The daughter of Oscar-nominated actor Sam Waterston and former model Lynn Woodruff, Katherine Boyer Waterston was born March 3, 1980 in Westminster, London, where her parents were working at the time. She was raised in Connecticut and through her father's career, gained exposure to film and television sets at an early age. Waterston attended New York University as a double major in theater and photography, but found the workload required to pursue both subjects too overwhelming, so she focused her energies on theater.  She made her small screen debut in ""Americana"" (2004), a television series pilot directed by David Schwimmer, before appearing in the short ""Orchids"" for actress-turned-director Bryce Dallas Howard. Waterston's screen acting career launched in earnest in 2007 with a feature film debut in Tony Gilroy's Oscar-nominated ""Michael Clayton,"" and she soon balanced regular appearances in features with roles on the New York stage. In 2008, she vaulted to the lead in ""Babysitters,"" playing a cagey honors student who supports her academic career by forming an escort ring that services the friends of a hapless suburbanite (John Leguizamo) whose child she babysits. Her performance set in motion a string of intense bit and supporting parts in independent features, including the comedy ""Taking Woodstock"" (2009), ""Being Flynn"" (2012) with Robert De Niro and Paul Dano, and as a kidnapping victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome in ""The Factory"" (2012) with John Cusack. During this period, Waterston was also a regular in theater productions, most notably Off-Broadway in ""Bachelorette"" (2010) and a revival of ""The Cherry Orchard"" (2011). By 2013, Waterston was appearing in several features per year, logging character roles in indie features like ""Manhattan Romance"" (2014) and the neo-noir ""Glass Chin"" (2014), which led to her breakout role as the vixenish Shasta Fay Hepworth in ""Inherent Vice"" (2014). Based on a novel by Thomas Pynchon and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the anarchic comedy-drama starred Joaquin Phoenix as a drug-addled private eye who is sent by his former lover (Waterston) to track down her current paramour, a missing real estate developer, which introduces him to an array of bizarre characters and situations. Waterston's no-holds-barred performance earned her an array of award nominations from critical societies, including the Satellite Awards and Denver Film Critics Society. The exposure afforded by ""Inherent Vice"" led to more high-profile projects, including the biopic ""Steve Jobs"" (2015), for which she played Chrisann Brennan, the high school girlfriend of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs."
Dan Fogler,"The affable comedic actor Dan Fogler made his name in theater first, when he portrayed the Tony Award winning character William Barfee in the Broadway musical hit ""The 25th Annual Putnum County Spelling Bee"". Fogler moved on to voice work for such landmark kid's films as ""Horton Hears a Who"" (2008) and ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008). His trademark head of dark curly hair was seen in a wide variety of television sitcoms like ""Man Up"" (ABC 2011) and ""M'Larky"" (Comedy Central 2010). However, Hollywood could never replace Broadway for this Brooklyn boy as he stayed active as artistic director in the ensemble production company Stage 13."
Alison Sudol,"Musician and actor Alison Sudol was known also as Alison Monro, and as the musician A Fine Frenzy. Sudol was born in Seattle, Washington in 1984 but relocated to Los Angeles at the age of 5 following her parents' divorce.  Both parents relocated to Los Angeles where Sudol attended school. She was passionate about music and literature as an adolescent and read avidly, mostly English literature and writers like C.S. Lewis, Lewis Carroll, and Charles Dickens. Sudol graduated from high school at the age of 16 and elected to put off college for two years to pursue music and to give herself time to mature before entering the college environment. However during the course of those two years Sudol found her musical voice and became so immersed in her creative practice that she chose to forego college altogether. She selected the project name A Fine Frenzy from a line in William Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" Sudol put out a demo that found its way to EMI's Jason Flom who visited Sudol and heard her play at her home. In 2007 her debut album One Cell in the Sea was released and reviewed with praise. She began touring with Rufus Wainwright in the same year before headlining a tour of her own in the US in 2008. A Fine Frenzy released the album Pines in 2012 after which Sudol elected to stop performing under that name, although she continued to write songs. In 2017 Sudol released a debut single under her own name. Sudol also pursued an interest in acting, appearing in the TV series ""Transparent"" (Amazon 2014-). She was also cast as Emma Wilson, an archaeologist, in the series ""Dig"" (USA, 2015). Sudol next appeared in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (2016), a movie based on the Harry Potter universe. Sudol also pursued a literary career, working on a fantasy story inspired by the books of C.S. Lewis."
Ezra Miller,"Ezra Miller made a career convincingly portraying tormented characters who harbored dark secrets, and had an unfathomable capacity to inflict pain on others as he did in the critically acclaimed drama ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" (2011). Yet, he also showcased his range by playing an ultra-cool, extroverted teenager in the indie darling, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" (2012). Miller first made waves on the independent film circuit, beginning with a featured role in ""Afterschool"" (2008), followed by a string of appearances in indies like ""Beware the Gonzo"" (2010) and ""Every Day"" (2010). But it was not until he starred in the chilling drama ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" as a teen psychopath who commits a Columbine-like mass murder that Miller truly caught the industry's attention. He continued to make inroads in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" where critics and audiences alike raved about his portrayal of an outgoing and benevolent teenager who helps a shy freshman overcome his insecurities. Undeniably, Miller's performances in both films not only proved his versatility but it also furthered his image as a Hollywood star on the rise."
Samantha Morton,"Born and raised in Nottingham, England, Samantha Morton had a tumultuous childhood. Separated from her parents by social services, Morton was raised in the English foster care system. At a young age, she found acting as an outlet, enrolling in the Central Junior Television Workshop when she was 13, and soon after began appearing on screen. Her first credits came in 1991 in supporting roles on the series' ""Soldier Soldier"" (ITV, 1991-97) and ""Boon"" (ITV, 1986-1992). Morton began to come into her own in the mid 1990s when she landed her first series leading role on ""Band of Gold"" (ITV, 1995-1997), played the title role in ""Jane Eyre"" (ITV, 1997), and the lead female role in the adaptation of ""The History of Tom Jones: A Foundling"" (BBC, 1997). In 1999, Morton broke through to international audiences with her role as a mute woman opposite Sean Penn in the Woody Allen film ""Sweet and Lowdown"" (1999). The film earned her universal accolades and a Best Supporting Actress nomination for an Academy Award® as well as a Golden Globe, among others. 2002 was another landmark year for the actress, earning further praise for her roles as the crucial 'precog' in ""Minority Report"" (2002), starring Tom Cruise and directed by Steven Spielberg, as well as a leading role in ""In America"" (2002), which earned her an Oscar nomination, this one for Best Actress. Morton continued to work in supporting roles, but also found time to direct her first film ""Unloved"" (2009), a semi-autobiographical story that she also wrote. In 2016, Morton earned accolades as one of the chief antagonists in ""Fantastic Creatures and Where to Find Them"" (2016). The next year she began a series regular role, playing a madam on the period show ""Harlots"" (Hulu, 2017-)."
Jon Voight,"Ever since he made his way into the American consciousness with his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Joe Buck, the naïve Texan-turned-New York City hustler in ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969), actor Jon Voight was associated with the angst and unruliness that typified the late-1960s counterculture. Prior to his breakthrough role, Voight had earned acclaim as a gifted performer on both stage and screen. But once he came into his own, the actor went on to star in some of the most important works of cinema being made by the New Hollywood of the 1970s. Following a supporting turn as the wheeling-dealing Milo Minderbinder in ""Catch-22"" (1970), he gave a sensitive portrayal of the intellectual Ed in the seminal ""Deliverance"" (1972). But it was his Academy Award-winning turn as an injured Vietnam veteran looking to heal both spiritually and physically in ""Coming Home"" (1978) that cemented his place in cinema history. Though he faltered a bit during the first half of the 1980s, Voight re-emerged with another award-worthy performance; this time playing a brutal escaped convict in ""Runaway Train"" (1985), which helped take his career in a new direction. He reached blockbuster status with supporting roles as various bad guys in ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), ""Enemy of the State"" (1998) and ""Varsity Blues"" (1999), while earning more acclaim for his portrayal of sportscaster Howard Cosell in ""Ali"" (2001) and President FDR in ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). Despite some bad press regarding his well-known estrangement with daughter and superstar Angelina Jolie and a hard right-turn into national politics, Voight nonetheless remained one of the more respected actors of his generation."
Henry Czerny,"Famous for playing double-crossers and villains, Henry Czerny was born in Toronto, Canada in 1959. He was still a small child when he first began showing an interest in acting, appearing in school plays, as well as in several musicals during his teens. After attending York University, Czerny enrolled at National Theatre School of Canada, where he focused on bettering himself for an already in-progress career acting on stage. After graduating and spending several years in the Canadian theater scene however, Czerny was eventually persuaded to expand into television, making his screen debut on a 1986 episode of the Canadian kids series ""The Edison Twins"" (CBC, 1982-86). His big break would come in 1992, when he was cast as an abusive priest in the Canadian film ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" (1992), a drama about the true story of several boys who were abused by the clergy running a Catholic orphanage. The role proved Czerny's range, and he was next seen playing the blustering CIA director in the political thriller ""Clear and Present Danger"" (1994). He would go on to co-star in ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), uttering the franchise's famous catchphrase ""This mission, if you choose to accept it "" and later appearing in the popular 1999 remake of ""The Pink Panther"" (1999). Czerny earned a particularly devoted cult following for his portrayal of Conrad Grayson on the series ""Revenge"" (ABC, 2011-15), which he stuck with from 2011 to 2015. In 2018, he joined Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson on the miniseries ""Sharp Objects"" (HBO, 2018-), based on the debut novel by thriller writer Gillian Flynn."
Kristin Scott Thomas,"One of the most well-regarded actresses of the 1990s and new millennium, England's Kristin Scott Thomas was an Oscar nominee whose poised and elegant work in such films as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994) and ""The English Patient"" (1996) impressed critics and moviegoers alike. After an auspicious debut in the Prince-directed ""Under the Cherry Moon"" (1986), she quickly proved herself capable of holding her own with such esteemed film legends as Judi Dench and Alec Guinness in ""A Handful of Dust"" (1988) before establishing herself as an international star with ""The English Patient."" A stint in Hollywood yielded hits like ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996) and ""The Horse Whisperer"" (1998), but she was soon back in Europe for independent-minded productions. Her profile was raised considerably by acclaimed performances on stage in ""The Seagull"" in 2007 and in the French feature ""I've Loved You So Long"" (2008), both of which cemented her status as one of the United Kingdom's most enduring and acclaimed actresses."
Jean Reno,"After making a name for himself in his native France, particularly with his collaborations with action director Luc Besson, actor Jean Reno crossed the Atlantic to become a highly-sought character performer in big budget Hollywood fare. Though he broke the ice with American audiences with the cult classic ""La Femme Nikita"" (1991), Reno made his greatest impression on U.S. shores playing a reluctant hit man training a young girl (Natalie Portman) in the strangely heartwarming thriller ""The Professional"" (1994). Ever since, Reno made his mark playing coolly ambiguous and frighteningly cunning characters who more often than not reveal themselves to be all-too-human. Reno was perhaps most memorable in action thrillers like ""Ronin"" (1998) and ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006), but least appreciated in silly blockbusters like ""Godzilla"" (1998) and ""The Pink Panther"" (2006). Despite not possessing a marquee name, Reno proved himself to be an invaluable character performer capable of switching from foreign films to Hollywood features with ease."
Philip Seymour Hoffman,"Widely recognized as one of the strongest stage and film actors of his generation, Philip Seymour Hoffman delivered knockout supporting roles in films like ""Boogie Nights"" (1997), ""Magnolia"" (1999) and ""Almost Famous"" (2000), before breaking out with an Oscar-winning lead as the famed author in ""Capote"" (2005). The co-creative director of New York's LAByrinth theater company brought theater-trained sensibilities and a fearless approach to some of cinema's most uncomfortably realistic portrayals, battling dark human urges, addictions, and moral conflicts with powerful if unflattering vulnerability. That was not to overlook Hoffman's considerable comedic talents, expressed in finely nuanced characterizations of a loyal assistant in ""The Big Lebowski"" (1997), a blocked screenwriter in ""State and Main"" (2000), a desperate former child actor in ""Along Came Polly"" (2004), and a maturity-challenged college professor in ""The Savages"" (2007). He even made the occasional blockbuster action thriller, playing the villain to Tom Cruise's hero in ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006). Still, Hoffman was most comfortable in more dramatically challenging films, delivering quality turns in ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" (2007) and Charlie Kaufman's ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008) before receiving well-deserved acclaim for his performance as the embattled Father Flynn in ""Doubt"" (2008). With standout supporting turns in ""Moneyball"" (2011) and ""The Hunger Games"" franchise, Hoffman solidified his standing as one of the best and most versatile actors working in Hollywood. His death via heroin overdose at the age of 46 stunned the acting community as well as his legion of fans."
Billy Crudup,"Though he always had the potential to be one of the bigger movie stars of his day, actor Billy Crudup eschewed the limelight for focus on playing complex characters in moody independent films. In fact, Crudup's intensity and his ability to disappear into character marked him as a highly gifted actor, though this same ability often played against the conventional wisdom for his becoming a movie star. He turned in strong and potentially star-making turns in more conventional features like ""Without Limits"" (1998) and ""The Hi-Lo Country"" (1998). Even when success eluded him when he was rock guitarist Russell Hammond in Cameron Crowe's well-received ""Almost Famous"" (2000), Crudup seemed to relish the freedom of not being a household name. That started to change with higher profile turns in ""Big Fish"" (2003), ""Mission: Impossible 3"" (2006), the highly anticipated ""Watchmen"" (2009) and the acclaimed made-for-cable television movie ""Too Big to Fail"" (HBO, 2011), all of which threatened to turn Crudup into a star, whether he wanted to be or not."
Michelle Monaghan,"Actress Michelle Monaghan burst onto big screens seemingly out of nowhere in the mid 2000s, launching right into commanding roles alongside A-listers like Tom Cruise, Charlize Theron and Leonardo DiCaprio in blockbuster thrillers and dramas. The former fashion model quickly proved she had more to bring to the party than just raven-haired bombshell looks, and her solid supporting performances in ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006) and ""Gone, Baby, Gone"" (2007) evolved into lead status in the actioner ""Eagle Eye"" (2008). Monaghan was eventually called upon to showcase her natural quick-wit and comedic talent with a crossover into romantic comedies like ""The Heartbreak Kid"" (2007) and ""Maid of Honor"" (2008), where the versatile actress confirmed that she had charm and appeal to spare."
Jonathan Rhys Meyers,"Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers first gained notoriety for his lead role in Todd Haynes' ""Velvet Goldmine"" (1998), a surreal examination of 1970s glam rock in which he portrayed a sort of fictional hybrid of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Meyers gave captivating performances in several controversial and little-seen films including Ang Lee's ""Ride with the Devil"" (1999) and the screen adaptation of ""Prozac Nation"" (2000) before receiving a profile boost in the British hit ""Bend it Like Beckham"" (2004). Following an Emmy-nominated performance as ""Elvis"" (2005) in the miniseries of the same name, Rhys Meyers began to appear in high-profile American features ""Match Point"" (2005) and ""Mission: Impossible III (2006). For his challenging work portraying the voracious King Henry VIII in ""The Tudors"" (Showtime, 2007-2010), Rhys Meyers received across-the-board accolades."
Dougray Scott,"A talented actor who saw two separate star-making roles slip through his fingers, Dougray Scott instead settled for a comfortable career as working actor. Appearances in European projects paved the way for his international breakthrough as the enlightened Prince Henry to Drew Barrymore's empowered Cinderella in ""EverAfter"" (1998). Hollywood took note, and Tom Cruise personally picked him to play the villain in ""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000). That film's tumultuous production forced Scott to surrender the role of Wolverine in ""X-Men"" (2000) to Hugh Jackman. Similarly, widespread industry rumors that Scott would replace Pierce Brosnan as James Bond proved for naught, so the actor moved to television, starring in the short-lived, sticky-fingered series ""Heist"" (NBC, 2006), and romancing Teri Hatcher for season three of ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC, 2004-12). Married to actress Claire Forlani in 2007, Scott appeared as a big screen heavy in the successful video game-to-movie ""Hitman"" (2007), won praise on the small screen as an ex-con in the family drama/crime thriller ""Father & Son"" (RTÉ One, 2009; ITV, 2010), and essayed the playwright Arthur Miller among a cast of heavyweights in ""My Week with Marilyn"" (2011). Although the Hollywood A-list seemed to have eluded him, the actor enjoyed a solid professional reputation, a steadily growing résumé and a quiet but sustained success."
Thandie Newton,"After an already enviable career, British actress Thandie Newton found herself swept into a pop culture whirlwind with her role in the sci-fi hit ""Westworld"" (HBO, 2016-). A native of London, the actress is of royal blood, the daughter of a Zimbabwean princess. She made her screen debut starring with Nicole Kidman in ""Flirting"" (1991). Supporting roles followed at regular intervals, including appearing with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in ""Interview With The Vampire"" (1994), playing Sally Hemings in ""Jefferson in Paris"" (1995), and haunting Oprah Winfrey in ""Beloved"" (1998). She found a wider audience when she re-teamed with Cruise for the blockbuster ""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000). She continued in a similar vein, starring with Mark Wahlberg in Jonathan Demme's ""The Truth About Charlie"" (2002) and with Vin Diesel in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" (2004). She then joined the ensemble of surprise Best Picture Oscar-winner ""Crash"" (2004), playing the wife of Terrence Howard's director. The role earned Newton a BAFTA. She went on to play Will Smith's estranged wife in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (2006) and was Eddie Murphy's romantic interest in the broad comedy ""Norbit"" (2007). She also had a memorable story arc on ""ER"" (NBC, 1994-2009) as a love interest to Noah Wyle's Dr. John Carter. After playing Condoleezza Rice in Oliver Stone's political drama ""W"" (2008), she returned to big budget fare starring in Roland Emmerich's disaster film ""2012"" (2009). A series of less successful film projects led the actress back to television. She starred in the limited series ""The Slap"" (ABC, 2015) and the police drama ""Rogue"" (Audience, 2013-17). She followed with her most acclaimed role in the updating of the Michael Crichton 1973 film ""Westworld."" Newton played the android Maeve Millay, the madame of a brothel who becomes self-aware. The actress was hailed by critics and earned multiple Emmy nominations for the role. Between long breaks in the shooting of the series, she appeared in a story arc of ""Line of Duty"" (BBC, 2012-) and became part of the ""Star Wars"" universe with a supporting role in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" (2018). She then joined Kit Harington and Natalie Portman for the drama ""The Death and Life of John F. Donovan"" (2018)."
Richard Roxburgh,"Known primarily in his native Australia for playing the leading man, actor Richard Roxburgh gained recognition with U.S. audiences for his scenery-chewing performances in several delightfully villainous roles. Roxburgh won critical acclaim for his based-on-fact portrayal of a corrupt cop in the miniseries ""Blue Murder"" (Australian Broadcasting Association - ABC, 1995), as well as his feature film performance in ""Doing Time with Patsy Cline"" (1997). Despite his homegrown success, it would be a supporting role as a sadistic henchman in the Tom Cruise action sequel ""Mission: Impossible 2"" (2000), followed by his sniveling, dastardly turn as the rodent-like Duke in Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001) that brought Roxburgh international attention. Temporarily finding his forte in Victorian-era genre fare, he took on a string of iconic characters in the films ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (PBS, 2002), ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003), and ""Van Helsing"" (2004). Roxburgh also established himself as a talented director on the award-winning biographical drama ""Romulus, My Father"" (2008). As he moved freely from Australian-produced film and TV projects to major Hollywood studio feature films, Roxburgh proved himself an exceptionally dexterous performer, able to deliver equally impressive performances in the role of leading man or supporting character."
John Polson,"Australian John Polson's long and successful career has included acting, directing, producing, and festival curation. His time as an actor began with a role in a made-for-TV movie about a 1950s rocker and ended with his appearance as Impossible Mission Force team-member Billy Baird in the spy thriller ""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000) and the spun-off video game ""Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma"" (2003). In 1993, at the Tropicana Cafe--a small, family-owned Italian restaurant in Sydney--Polson held the first annual Tropicana Short Film Festival. Now known as TropFest, it has grown into the largest short film festival in the world with satellite competitions in Paris, Las Vegas and New York City. Polson's breakthrough feature as a director, ""Siam Sunset,"" was a 1999 comedy about a vacation gone wrong. But since then he has worked primarily in the action and thriller genres, from 2002's Hitchcock-influenced teen movie ""Swimfan"" to the 2009 mystery ""Tenderness,"" with Academy Award-winner Russell Crowe. Polson has applied his aptitude for directing grippingly suspenseful scenes to episodes of several television shows, including FOX's ""Fringe"" and ABC's ""FlashForward""--two shows that employ that proven hit combination of science fiction and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
