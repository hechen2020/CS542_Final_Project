Adam McKay,"A veteran of Chicago's improvisational comedy scene, Adam McKay co-founded the popular and influential Upright Citizens Brigade comedy troupe, served as head writer on ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ) and wrote and directed a string of hit comedies starring his production partner, Will Ferrell, including ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (2004) before delving into political satire with the critically praised and award-nominated ""The Big Short"" (2015) and ""Vice"" (2018),  Born April 17, 1968 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, McKay was raised by his mother, who worked as a waitress; his father, a musician, left the family when McKay was seven years of age. During this period, he found both solace and inspiration in television comedy, including the broad antics of the Three Stooges, and after stints at both Pennsylvania State University and Temple University, McKay decided to pursue a path in comedy by studying under legendary teacher Del Close at Chicago's Improv Olympic. He later formed his own improv group, the Upright Citizen's Brigade, with such future comedy stars as Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh and Matt Besser. His work with the group - which was marked by a political bent and a decidedly dark streak - led to McKay performing with the main stage group at the famed Second City, and in 1995, a chance to audition for ""Saturday Night Live."" Though he did not make the cut as a performer, producer Lorne Michaels brought him aboard as a writer in 1995, where he met and befriended new cast member Will Ferrell. Together, the pair created some of Ferrell's most memorable creations for the series, including a dim-witted take on then-President George W. Bush; McKay eventually rose to head writer for ""SNL"" before departing in 2001, with Ferrell following suit in 2002. The pair scored a substantial hit with ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" with McKay directing and co-writing and Ferrell starring as an awesomely clueless newscaster; its success begat a string of box office windfalls, including ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" (2006), ""Step Brothers"" (2008) and ""The Other Guys"" (2010), as well as Funny Or Die, a user-submitted comedy video site that generated a slew of popular series, including the long-running ""Drunk History"" (Comedy Central, 2013- ), the irreverent online talk show spoof ""Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifiniakis"" (2008- ), the game show ""Billy on the Street"" (Fuse TV, 2011-15) with Billy Eichner and HBO's ""Funny or Die Presents"" (2010-11). McKay soon became the go-to creative force for broad, absurd comedies on film and television, and lent his talents to a slew of projects ranging from the Ferrell vehicles ""Land of the Lost"" (2009), ""Get Hard"" (2015) and ""Daddy's Home"" (2015) to the HBO series ""Eastbound & Down"" (2009-2013) with Danny McBride and a script rewrite for Marvel's ""Ant-Man"" (2015) with Paul Rudd. In the midst of this flurry of activity, McKay took a turn towards dramatic fare with an adaption of Michael Lewis's non-fiction book ""The Big Short"" (2015), which attempted to explain the 2007-2008 financial crisis caused by the U.S. housing bubble. Its irreverent, biting satire won critical praise and earned McKay and Charles Randolph an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as Oscar nods for Best Picture and Best Director. He then returned to a sizable stable of comedy projects, including ""The Boss"" (2016), with Melissa McCarthy, and ""Daddy's Home 2"" (2017), he wrote and directed ""Vice"" (2018), a darkly comic look at the life of former Vice President Dick Cheney, played by Christian Bale. Though reaction was split over McKay's depiction of Cheney as a cold, manipulative power broker, the film reaped numerous accolades, including Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for McKay."

Andrew Stanton,"A key figure in the development of Pixar Studios, Andrew Stanton was the writer-director of some of the computer animation company's biggest hits, including ""Toy Story"" (1995), ""A Bug's Life"" (1998), ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) and ""WALL-E."" In the grand tradition of Disney's animation team from the 1930s and such legendary figures as Ray Harryhausen and Don Bluth, Stanton's best films were a near-perfect balance of breathtaking visuals and heart-tugging emotion; the lifelike quality of cowboy toy Woody or the silent, industrious robot WALL-E never overwhelmed their fully rendered hopes and dreams and ambitions. The combination of these elements brought Stanton significant acclaim and considerable awards, but more importantly, it established him as one of the most creative figures in motion pictures - live action and animated - working in 21st century Hollywood."

Christopher Markus,"Going from Narnia to the Marvel Universe isn't a trip a lot of people get to make, but Christopher Markus got the once-in-a-lifetime chance to do so when he finished up working on three ""Chronicles of Narnia"" movies as a screenwriter and then went over to work on Captain America and Thor movies for Marvel. Working with his longtime partner Stephen McFeely, Markus carved a role as a reliable screenwriter for well-received blockbuster movies. Markus took his time becoming a screenwriter, though, going to Rutgers University for his undergraduate degree and then going to University of California at Davis for his Master's. It was there that he met his writing partner McFeely. However, it took many years past Markus' 1996 graduation from UC Davis before he was officially a professional writer. In the early 2000s, the pair pitched HBO for ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" (2004), a made-for-TV movie starring Geoffrey Rush as Sellers that wound up garnering Markus and McFeely an Emmy Award. They followed that up with ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" (2005), the first of three big-budget Narnia movies from Disney. They worked on the film's two sequels, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" (2008) and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" (2010), though they only did a draft of the latter as they were let go from the project during the 2008 Writers Guild Strike. While working on the Narnia movies, they also wrote a crime comedy called ""You Kill Me"" (2007) that starred Tea Leoni and Ben Kingsley. After their time in Narnia, the writing partners started working in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, first writing ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) before working on ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013) and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) back-to-back. At the same, they also wrote ""Pain & Gain"" (2013), an action comedy directed by Michael Bay and starring Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson. After the commercial and critical success of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" it was announced that Markus and McFeely were signed to write the third Captain America movie, set for a 2016 release."
Christopher McQuarrie,"As the childhood friend and frequent collaborator of director Bryan Singer, screenwriter and sometime helmer Christopher McQuarrie was catapulted to the upper echelons of the screenwriting world after winning the Oscar for the widely hailed noir thriller ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995). In breaking all the rules for screenwriting - mainly because he was unaware of them - McQuarrie redefined the crime-noir genre and became one of the most sought-after writers in the business. But such blessings came with a price after he was given the chance to direct his first feature, ""The Way of the Gun"" (2000), a graphic thriller that polarized audiences and critics on its way to becoming a box office failure. For the next seven plus years, McQuarrie was trapped in development hell on a number of movies that never made it to production, frustrating him to the point of wanting to quit the business altogether. But Singer managed to pull his old friend back in by directing McQuarrie's spec script for ""Valkyrie"" (2008), a World War II thriller about a Nazi plot to assassinate Hitler. From there, he wrote the scripts for two more critically derided films, ""Killshot"" (2009) and ""The Tourist"" (2010), but managed to earn praise for writing and directing the highly anticipated adaptation of ""Jack Reacher"" (2012) and ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" (2015). Whether behind the camera or the keyboard, McQuarrie's gift for telling unique stories and redefining genre tropes remained the one constant in his otherwise turbulent career."

Damien Chazelle,"The backbone and inspiration of many of Damien Chazelle's films was always his love of music, first seen in his black and white musical ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench."" Music then became the subject of his award-winning short--and then later feature--鈥砏hiplash.鈥?Born in Rhode Island in 1985, Chazelle grew up in both France and America; his comfort with two cultures strongly informed his film work. He began his first film, a short entitled 鈥矴uy and Madeline on a Park Bench鈥?(2009), as his thesis for his Masters at Harvard in Visual and Environmental Studies. Over the next two years, he developed it into a full length feature, utilizing friends and a 16mm camera to tell the story of a woman and a jazz musician. After graduation he moved out to Los Angeles with a plan to connect with the film studios through his work as a screenplay writer for hire. By 2009 he had taken 鈥矴uy and Madeline on a Park Bench鈥?to festivals where it gained some notice and several awards including recognition as an emerging artist at the Denver International Film Festival and a Jury Special Prize at the Torino International Film Festival. He continued to hone his writing skills as a screenwriter in Hollywood and began to write his next feature, 鈥砏hiplash鈥?(2013). This film was much more personal, an insider's dark look at the powerful emotions and obsessions that drive music students. As a former student at musical academies, it was a subject he knew quite well. When he found the script a tough sell, he listened to advice and took a scene from it to develop as a short film. The short created buzz across the 2013 film festival circuit and won numerous awards including the Short Film Jury Prize at Sundance. New interest in the original led to the feature-length script being included on the coveted 鈥矪lack List鈥?of unproduced films considered by studios. With this help, funding was secured and the feature-length film 鈥砏hiplash鈥?was produced, winning awards and acclaim from Sundance to Cannes. Chazelle's next project moved even further into his love of music: ""La La Land"" (2016) was a full-fledged musical, with elaborate song and dance numbers throughout. Stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling did all their own singing and dancing as a struggling actress and idealistic jazz pianist. The critically acclaimed box office hit scored 14 Oscar nominations, tying the record set by ""All About Eve"" (1951) and ""Titanic"" (1997), and won six, including Best Original Score, Best Original Song (for the film's love theme ""City of Stars""), Best Director and Best Actress. In one of the most shocking moments in Oscar history, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced that ""La La Land"" had won Best Picture and producer Jordan Horowitz was most of the way through his acceptance speech before it was revealed that a mistake had been made: the true winner of the Best Picture award was indie drama ""Moonlight"" (2016)."

Edgar Wright,"The mastermind behind the so-called ""Cornetto Trilogy"" of ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007) and ""The World's End"" (2013), as well as the cult-favorite British comedy series ""Spaced"" (Channel 4 1999-2001), director Edgar Wright first became known for his collaborations with actor/writer Simon Pegg, but soon established himself as a gifted filmmaker in his own right through quirky, inventive works like video game homage ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World"" (2010), his script for Marvel Universe blockbuster ""Ant-Man"" (2015), and car chase epic ""Baby Driver"" (2017). Wright grew up in rural England, so obsessed with ""Star Wars"" and horror films that in his early teens, he made his own movies with a second-hand 8mm camera. Just as he fused fresh, brilliant comedy with solid horror and action production values, Wright himself combined a love of movies with old-fashioned hard work and ingenuity from the very beginning, making primitive movies with his classmates and friends with money made stocking shelves at a supermarket after school. Considering his inspired fake horror film trailer in the middle of the B-movie tribute ""Grindhouse"" (2007), Wright never lost sight of his original love of all movies, big and small."
Emily Halpern,
Emily V. Gordon,"Emily Vance Gordon was born in 1979 in Winston-Salem, NC. Upon enrollment in University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1997, Gordon pursued a major in psychology, accruing a Bachelor's degree therein, followed by a Master's of Science in Education in couple's counseling in 2003. Over the six years to follow, Gordon practiced therapy professionally, first in North Carolina, then in Chicago, IL, where she met and began a romantic relationship with then-aspiring comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani. In 2007, Gordon was diagnosed with Still's disease and placed into a medically induced coma for eight days, an experience that would inspire her first screenplay a decade later. Following this episode, Gordon and Nanjiani moved to New York City, where they married, and then to Los Angeles, at which point she eschewed her standing psychotherapy practice to pursue a career as a writer. She began contributing to publications including The New York Times, The Huffington Post, and The Atlantic, among many others; around the same time, she and Nanjiani, along with comedian Jonah Ray, began producing a weekly live performance hosted at Los Angeles' Meltdown Comics. The popularity of the show earned Gordon the attention of entertainer and Nerdist CEO Chris Hardwick, who hired her in 2011 to serve as program director of the regular live performance Nerdist Showroom; the project also earned the attention of Comedy Central, which launched the television series ""The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail"" (Comedy Central 2014-16), which featured the irrepressibly perky Gordon in her backstage role as the show's producer and manager. During production of the program, Gordon and Nanjiani collaborated on their first feature screenplay ""The Big Sick"" (2017), which chronicled their romantic relationship and Gordon's experiences with the aforementioned medically-induced coma."
Eric Heisserer,"Eric Heisserer was an American screenwriter who earned his first Oscar nomination in 2017 for writing the screenplay to the acclaimed science-fiction film ""Arrival"" (2016). Although Heisserer never intended on making his living as a screenwriter, you might say that a professional writing career was in his blood. His mother worked as an editor for a publishing company, while his father worked as a writer and professor of ancient history. For Eric Heisserer, however, his introduction into the writing world came when he took a position writing narratives for video games. Heisserer worked in the video games industry for a number of years, and mostly enjoyed the work. However, on one such occasion he turned in a video game script that was rejected on account of that fact that it was, as Heisserer later recalled, ""too linear, like a movie."" This initial rejection was the impetus that launched Heisserer into the world of screenwriting. Admittedly, his first few screenplays were awful, but the more he honed his craft, the better the writing became. He sold his first script to Warner Bros. in 2005, and had his first screenplay produced in 2010 with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" - a reboot of the classic 80s horror film. Heisserer had two more screenplays produced the following year with ""Final Destination 5"" (2011) and ""The Thing"" (2011), both of which were horror films. Heisserer made his directorial debut in 2013 with ""Hours,"" which he also wrote. The film was notable for being released shortly after the tragic death of its star Paul Walker. For his next big writing project Heisserer was asked to adapt a shorty story called ""Story of Your Life"" written by the acclaimed science-fiction writer Ted Chiang. After working on multiple versions of the script, which was renamed to ""Arrival,"" the film premiered to rave reviews in November of 2016. Heisserer's script was primarily singled out by critics for its high level of depth and craftsmanship. As a result, when Oscar nominations were announced in early 2017, Heisserer received a nod for his ""Arrival"" screenplay, while the film received eight Academy Award nominations in total. It was Heisserer's first Oscar nomination."
Eric Pearson,
Eric Roth,"Though he emerged directly from film school to become a professional screenwriter, Eric Roth spent the first half of his career struggling to find his footing.  After two box office duds in the late-1970s, Roth waited another nine years for his next credited project, ""Suspect"" (1987), which itself suffered from a lack of audience interest. It was not until his Oscar-winning adaptation of ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) that Roth began to emerge as a prominent Hollywood scribe. But his career almost took a turn toward disaster with his next film, ""The Postman"" (1997), a sci-fi epic that proved to be almost ruinous for all involved, especially Roth, who had, up to that point, a trail of failures and only one success. Things began an upward trajectory that rarely wavered off course when he wrote the excellent drama, ""The Insider"" (1999), which earned critical kudos for its complex and richly developed tale about a real-life whistleblower who risks everything to tell the truth about the tobacco industry. Ever since that film, Roth churned out scripts for several more notable films - including ""Munich"" (2005) and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008) - which finally helped land him on secure ground while becoming one of the most highly sought-after screenwriters working in Hollywood."

J.K. Rowling,"Prior to becoming one of the best-selling authors of all time, J.K. Rowling struggled with all manner of life problems that would have sent most mere mortals spiraling into pits of despair, never to be heard from again. Rowling, on the other hand, channeled her misfortunes into self-determination, achieving her lifelong goal of being a successful writer, and along the way, creating one of the best known and beloved characters in contemporary literature. Her creation of Harry Potter - an angst-ridden boy who explores his powers as a budding magician while coping with the tragic loss of his parents and the frustrations of growing into an adult - would capture the imaginations of both children and adults. Little did Rowling know that when Potter magically appeared to her while on route to London via train that he would become such an international star, both in books and on the big screen, and would turn the once down-and-out writer into a multi-millionaire. Despite the immense popularity of her creation, Rowling tried - often futilely - to maintain her privacy. But Harry Potter took on a life of its own, thanks to the legions of fans who emptied bookshelves or crowded multiplexes whenever the next installment came to light, putting the reluctant author into the awkward position of being an international celebrity. Although Rowling went on to publish several other novels, including the wry small-town politics satire The Casual Vacancy, she not only happily acknowledged the boy wizard's role in her life, she returned to his magical world in various forms, including a stage play picking up the characters as adults and a related film, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (2016)."

After this, he took on his first big series, producing and writing many of the episodes for the hit action show ""Alias,"" created by J.J. Abrams and starring Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, an international spy. After this, Pinkner was the executive producer and sometime writer for the addictive serial drama ""Lost,"" starring Matthew Fox and Michael Emerson, among others, as the survivors of a plane crash forced to live together and form some kind of community on a remote island. ""Lost"" went off the air with a puzzling final episode in 2010, and Pinkner kept busy producing and writing for another J.J. Abrams show, ""Fringe,"" a drama about a female FBI agent."
Joe Cornish,"Writer/director Joe Cornish exploded onto the international film scene in 2011 with his urban extraterrestrial epic, ""Attack the Block."" Having received widespread acclaim and a BAFTA nomination for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director, or Producer, the film marked a realization of the talent promised by Cornish's earlier works. His first gig came on Channel 4 sketch series ""The Adam and Joe Show,"" which Cornish wrote, co-starred in, edited, and directed with comedian Adam Buxton. Cornish subsequently fell in with cult English director Edgar Wright, appearing in minor roles as a featured zombie in ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and a cop in ""Hot Fuzz."" He also received a ""Thanks"" credit on Wright's kaleidoscopic action flick, ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World."" It was only a matter of time before the two officially collaborated; Cornish and Wright served as co-screenwriters on ""The Adventures of Tintin."" Helmed by Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, the film employed innovative motion-capture technology to bring life to the iconic Belgian comic book character. ""The Adventures of Tintin"" went on to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature."" Cornish also penned the screenplay for a long-dormant adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Ant-Man,"" with Wright in line to direct."

John Francis Daley,"Often, child actors fade into nonexistence after their first big break. After becoming familiar faces and maybe even a household name, young actors generally wind up becoming more of a factoid or an answer to a trivia question than a serious actor. For John Francis Daley, who cut his teeth in ""Freaks & Geeks"" (NBC 1999-2000) and the 1994 touring production of ""The Who's Tommy,"" that wasn't the case. Despite finding success as a teenager, Daley bucked the trend, carving out a path that led to a career with many notable roles in television and film. Eventually he moved onto screenwriting, penning everything from R-rated comedies such as ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011) to family films such as ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" (2013) before moving into the director chair with their franchise reboot ""Vacation"" (2015) and scoring a blockbuster hit with their screenplay for ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017)."

Jonathan M. Goldstein,"Born in New York City to two educator parents, Jonathan Goldstein didn't set out to become a comedy writer. After graduating from the University of Michigan he went on to Harvard Law School, then worked as a corporate attorney for three years before deciding to chuck it and head for Hollywood. Once in Los Angeles, he found quick success, landing writing work on ""Big Wolf On Campus"" (ABC Family, 1999-2002), the Eddie Murphy animated comedy ""The PJ's"" (Fox, 1999-2001), and the sitcom ""The Geena Davis Show"" (ABC, 2000-2001). It was on ""The Geena Davis Show"" that Goldstein met his future writing partner, John Francis Daley, who was an actor on the show. Their collaboration first bore fruit in form of the script for a feature film, ""The $40,000 Man,"" that was purchased by New Line in 2007.  Although that film was never produced, the pair went on to write an episode of ""Bones"" (Fox, 2005- ), the crime procedural on which Daley co-starred. The duo hit box office gold with their film ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011), which became the highest-grossing black comedy of all time. Although the follow-up ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (2013) did not fare as well, it was announced in 2012 that the pair would write and direct a reboot of ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" with Ed Helms playing a grown up Rusty Griswold and Christina Applegate as his wife. The proposed film ended up being shelved over a dispute with the studio about ratings. In the meantime, Goldstein and Daley wrote the family-friendly animated sequel, ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2"" (2013) and a follow-up to their breakthrough hit, ""Horrible Bosses 2"" (2014). Goldstein and Daley's next project was the screenplay for mega-blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017)."

Justin Theroux,"An exceptionally versatile character actor and occasional lead in features and television, Justin Theroux tackled both comedy and drama with equal deftness throughout his career, and proved himself a talented writer as well by penning the scripts for hits like ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008) and ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). A handsome actor who seemed to prefer offbeat portrayals over leading man roles, he began his onscreen career in indies like ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" (1996) before moving effortless into Hollywood titles like ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" (1997). He was adept at playing slick, soulless professionals, like an arrogant film director in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" (2001) and a business friend of Christian Bale's deranged Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho"" (2000), but could also play thoughtful, caring men, like his cerebral suitor who charmed Rachel Griffiths on ""Six Feet Under"" (HBO, 2001-05). Theroux's strongest suit, however, was offbeat comedy, and he mined that field on numerous occasions throughout his career in features like ""Zoolander"" (2001) and ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" (2003). He made a modest debut as a director on the indie drama ""Dedication"" (2007), but found greater success as a writer on the over-the-top comedy ""Tropic Thunder"" and the blockbuster ""Iron Man 2."" His dual status as favored actor and screenwriter made Theroux a genuine hyphenate. His marriage to Jennifer Aniston, whom he met on the set of the David Wain comedy ""Wanderlust"" (2012), threatened to overshadow his work, especially following their February 2018 separation, but his work in films ranging from ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016) to ""The Lego Ninjago Movie"" (2017) kept him onscreen as well as in the gossip columns."

He wrote for some of the hippest and most ground-breaking TV comedies of his era, and still found time to co-host a podcast about the nerd world of video games while putting together a weekly live show that helped put Los Angeles back on the map of stand-up. Born in Karachi, Pakistan in 1978, Nanjiani moved to Iowa with his family when he was 18. In college, he first discovered stand-up by listening to his uncle's tapes of comedy acts, and he became obsessed. By his junior year in college he began doing his own stand-up routines. His major in computer sciences, gave him a solid nerd-culture base for his act as he drifted slowly into the comedy world of New York City. He worked briefly as a writer on ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ), but his work on the short-lived sketch program ""Michael and Michael Have Issues"" (Comedy Central 2009) gave him his first taste of acting. The producers wanted the writers to also have bit parts on the show, and Nanjiani discovered that the acting informed his writing, and the writing improved his acting. Along with his burgeoning stand-up career, Nanjiani had small roles in the films ""Life As We Know It"" (2010) and ""The Five Year Engagement"" (2012). During this era, Nanjiani moved from New York to Los Angeles, where podcast impresario Chris Hardwick invited him to create a show about comic books. Since he knew video games much better, he convinced Hardwick to center the show on video game obsessions. The podcast, The Indoor Kids, was co-hosted by Nanjiani's wife, comic and writer Emily V. Gordon. As if the television appearances, movies and podcasts weren't enough, Nanjiani also started co-hosting a weekly stand-up show in the back room of a Los Angeles comic book store called The Meltdown alongside fellow comic Jonah Ray. The show, which featured rising and known comics doing new, improvisational and experimental material, was so successful that in 2014 Comedy Central signed it up to become one of the network's live comedy showcases; the shows ended in 2016 when the pair's other duties began taking too much of their time. Nanjiani also continued to act, appearing regularly as various characters on Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein's offbeat comedy series ""Portlandia"" (IFC 2011- ) and taking on a co-starring role in Mike Judge's satirical series ""Silicon Valley"" (HBO 2014- ). Nanjiani and Gordon branched into screenwriting with ""The Big Sick"" (2017), an autobiographical comedy about their courtship that starred Nanjiani as himself and Zoe Kazan as Emily."
Leigh Whannell,"Australian actor, screenwriter and producer Leigh Whannell is best known-some might say notorious-for his horror collaborations with director James Wan, most notably the original ""Saw"" (2004) and the ""Insidious"" films. After a few Aussie TV roles in his youth, he appeared briefly in the sci-fi sequel ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) and became intent on writing his own film with Wan. The result was the bloody and unexpected hit ""Saw,"" which made a huge return on its small budget, prompting a slew of sequels. Whannell co-penned ""Saw II"" (2005) and ""Saw III"" (2006) and served as an executive producer on the films. He later moved on to co-writing ""Dead Silence"" (2007) with Wan, but the movie wasn't successful critically or commercially. In 2010, Whannell and his go-to collaborator reunited for the supernatural film ""Insidious."" The eerie and unsettling tale, which featured Whannell as a paranormal investigator's assistant, was a huge hit. In 2013, he returned for ""Insidious: Chapter 2,"" which was well received, and once again showcased his clear talents as both a screenwriter and supporting actor."

Paul Rudd,"Armed with effortless charm and a disarming smile, actor Paul Rudd made his name on stage and screen in a number of notable projects, as well as cultivating an avid following as both a sensitive leading man and as a comic foil. While he became vaguely recognizable thanks to several prominent film and television roles - namely as Alicia Silverstone's know-it-all stepbrother in ""Clueless"" (1995), Phoebe's husband on ""Friends"" (NBC, 1994-2004), and Jennifer Aniston's gay best friend in the romantic comedy ""The Object of My Affection"" (1998) - Rudd eventually rode the Judd Apatow wave to stardom with a series of surprisingly successful comedies in which he was more often than not, the primary scene-stealer. His roles in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005), ""Knocked Up"" (2007), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008), ""Role Models"" (2008) and ""I Love You, Man"" (2009) established the versatile actor, who oscillated easily between comedy and drama both on screen and on stage, as a bona fide box-office force and a rising star. Because of his raised profile, Rudd was able to take bigger risks in less mainstream projects, as he did for ""Dinner for Schmucks"" (2010) and ""Our Idiot Brother"" (2011). He took a step back with a leading role in James L. Brooks' critically maligned romantic comedy ""How Do You Know"" (2010) and stepped into a producer's role for the low-budget ""Wanderlust"" (2011), and later became an unlikely superhero in the Marvel hit ""Ant-Man"" (2015). But regardless of his projects' success or lack thereof, moviegoers held great reserves of goodwill for the actor. No matter how big or small the project, Rudd became one of Hollywood's most popular and marketable stars."
Phil Lord,"Phil Lord was an American writer, director and producer, half of a film and television making duo with Christopher Miller whose works included the ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" movies, ""21 Jump Street"" (2011), and ""The Lego Movie"" (2013). This string of successes made them among the most commercially viable filmmakers of the early 2010s. Lord was born on July 12, 1975 in Miami, Florida. A 1997 graduate of Dartmouth College, Lord met Miller while the two were in college. Lord and Miller first broke into the entertainment industry when they landed a pair of recurring roles in the Lea Thompson sitcom ""Caroline in the City"" (NBC 1995-99). Meanwhile, Lord and Miller began their careers as writers on ""Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane"" (The WB, 1999-2000), a short-lived sitcom that starred Selma Blair and Michael Rosenbaum. Although Lord and Miller's early days were filled with short-lived roles and plenty of failures -- including a failed drawing test for the ""The Rugrats Movie"" -- the duo continued to work on their ideas, including an animated series about a high school populated by clones of famous historical figures that they pitched to several networks. Their first break occurred when Lord and Miller convinced MTV to turn their idea into a series. ""Clone High"" (MTV 2002-03) was the result, with Lord and Miller working on multiple fronts as writer, producer, director and voice actor on the animated series. Although ""Clone High"" only lasted one season, it proved to be a turning point in their careers. Although their next project, the culture-clash sitcom ""Luis"" (Fox 2003) was almost immediately cancelled after its debut, they jumped aboard a new sitcom called ""How I Met Your Mother"" (CBS 2005-2014). The show became a hit, with Lord and Miller credited as the writers of the episodes ""Belly Full of Turkey"" and ""The Sweet Taste of Liberty"" and co-executive producers on 17 episodes of the show's first season. Lord and Miller pounced on the opportunities that quickly sprouted. They made their feature film directorial debut with ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" (2009), a computer animated science fiction comedy based on a children's book about a scientist's weather machine gone horribly awry. Starring the voices of Bill Hader and Anna Faris, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" was a critical and commercial success. It was nominated for a couple of Annie Awards and a Best Animated feature nod at the 67th Golden Globe Awards. The duo followed ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" with ""21 Jump Street"" (2011), a feature film reboot of an old 1980s television series that starred Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, ""21 Jump Street"" was a surprise success. The duo returned to direct ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" (2013) and served as executive producers on former ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ) cast member Andy Samberg's police sitcom ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" (Fox 2013-). Lord and Miller had their next blockbuster success with ""The Lego Movie"" (2013), an animated feature with an all-star cast that included Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell and Elizabeth Banks. (The pair served as producers for the film's sequels, including ""The Lego Batman Movie"" (2017) and ""The Lego Ninjago Movie"" (2017), but didn't write or direct them.) After directing the sequel ""22 Jump Street"" (2014), Lord and Miller returned to TV as executive producers of ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Fox 2015- ), a quirky sitcom starring Will Forte and Kristen Schaal as the heads of a band of survivors of an unnamed apocalypse. The part-animated dysfunctional-family sitcom ""Son of Zorn"" (Fox 2016-17) and time travel comedy ""Making History"" (Fox 2017) followed, but both were canceled after a single season. In 2016, Lord and Miller were named as directors of a 2018 standalone film in the Star Wars Universe starring Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo. Principal photography began in March 2017, but in June of that year, the pair were removed from the film following reported creative differences with producers and replaced by Ron Howard."
Sam Mendes,"Because of his highly technical and visual theater productions in London and on Broadway, Sam Mendes made a smooth transition to film with ""American Beauty"" (1999), which earned him an Academy Award for his directing debut. Previous to his Oscar triumph, Mendes enjoyed a long and very successful career in theater, directing acclaimed and visually stunning productions of William Shakespeare's ""The Tempest,"" Tennessee Williams' ""The Glass Menagerie,"" and Lionel Bart's popular musical ""Oliver!"" But it was his 1998 revival of ""Cabaret"" that attracted the attention of Hollywood - specifically Mendes fan Steven Spielberg, which led to the stage veteran directing his first feature. Following a few aborted film efforts and a triumphant return to theatre, Mendes returned to celluloid with the elaborate, lavish ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), which displayed some of the promise of his sterling debut, but ultimately failed to warm many hearts. Nonetheless, he maintained a steady output on stage and on screen, directing the Iraq War drama ""Jarhead"" (2005) and '50s period piece ""Revolutionary Road"" (2008), which starred his then-wife, Kate Winslet. Mendes took a huge commercial leap forward as the director of the 23rd and 24th James Bond films, ""Skyfall"" (2012) and ""Spectre"" (2015), which brought new emotional depth to the long-running series while confirming his status as an intelligent and deliberate filmmaker capable of crafting deeply resonant films."

Scott Derrickson,"Writer/director Scott Derrickson gave America nightmares with a series of slick scary movies. Seeing that so many of his films deal with the nature of good and evil, god and the devil, it should come as no surprise that Derrickson studied theology alongside literature, philosophy and film at Biola University, CA, a university known for its evangelical Christian viewpoint. Moving to the USC School of Cinematic Arts to study film production, Derrickson made his mark directing and co-writing (with regular collaborator Paul Harris Boardman) the short ""Love in Ruins"" (1995). His next project was as writer on slasher sequel ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" (2000) before taking his first trip to hell writing and directing ""Hellraiser: Inferno"" (2000) the fifth installment in the long running horror franchise. After working with Wim Wenders on ""Land of Plenty"" (2004), Derrickson's first breakout hit was as director on ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" (2005), once again co-written with Boardman. This lead to Derrickson directing the big budget remake of sci-fi classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008) starring Keanu Reeves. Despite generally bad reviews, it still claimed the number one spot at the American box-office on opening weekend and went onto earn over $230 million worldwide. However it was a return to the supernatural with the deeply creepy ""Sinister"" (2012) which saw Derrickson pick up fans and critical plaudits alongside multiple awards and nominations on the horror film circuit. Stepping down from directing Derrickson and Boardman wrote the script for ""The Devil's Knot"" (2013), a crime drama with a satanic twist, directed by Atom Egoyan and starring Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon. Derrickson returned to directing with ""Deliver Us From Evil"" (2014) based on the book ""Beware the Night"" (2001). In June 2014 Derrickson was confirmed as director of ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) with Benedict Cumberbatch taking the title role."
Scott Frank,"When considering darkly comic noirs like ""Get Shorty"" (1995) and ""Out of Sight"" (1998), or the bleak futuristic thriller ""Minority Report"" (2002), one could envision a haunted, brooding writer comfortable only in a seedy dive bar. But screenwriter Scott Frank - both affable and boyish in his late 40s - has been a far cry from Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett, possessing instead the demeanor of a friendly English teacher or a kindly neighbor who loans out his snow blower with no questions asked.  Frank built a reputation as one of the most reliable and highly-paid screenwriters in the business, balancing book and short story adaptations with lucrative - and occasionally uncredited - rewrite gigs. While other successful writers bemoaned their lack of respect in Hollywood, Frank flourished with sanity and optimism intact, becoming one of the few widely known successes in a profession typically hidden behind closed doors."
Scott Rosenberg,
Simon Blackwell,"Prolific British television writer Simon Blackwell was a major creative force behind writer-producer Armando Iannucci's award-winning series ""The Thick of It"" (BBC Four, 2005-2012) and ""Veep"" (HBO, 2012- )Born May 27,1966 in the South London district of Battersea, Blackwell began his professional writing career in 1997, penning scripts for BBC Radio comedies like ""The Sunday Format"" (BBC Radio 4, 1996- ) and ""Dead Ringers"" (BBC Radio Two/Four, 2002-2007, 2014- ). Two years later, he moved into writing for television, contributing to specials, variety series and award shows like the International Emmy Award-winning ""The Kumars at No. 42"" (BBC One/Two, 2001- ) and ""Gash"" (Channel 4, 2003), which marked his first collaboration with Armando Iannucci. Two years later, Blackwell reteamed with Iannucci and several other ""Gash"" writers for the celebrated political satire ""The Thick of It,"" which earned him two BAFTA TV Award nominations. With Iannucci, Blackwell also co-wrote ""In the Loop"" (2009), a feature film spun off from ""Thick"" that earned an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay. During this period, he also contributed to ""Thick Of It"" writer Jesse Armstrong's acclaimed comedy series ""Peep Show"" (Channel 4, 2003-2016) and ""The Old Guys"" (BBC One, 2009- ), as well as his feature ""Four Lions"" (2010), about an inept quartet of would-be terrorists. In 2012, he reunited again with Iannucci as writer and executive producer for the HBO comedy ""Veep,"" for which he earned two Emmys - Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series - 2015. While producing ""Veep,"" Blackwell also stepped out on his own to create ""Trying Again"" (Sky Living, 2014), a melancholy comedy about a couple attempting to rebuild their relationship after an affair."
