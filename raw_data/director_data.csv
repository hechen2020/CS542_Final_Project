Directors,Descriptions
Alan Taylor,"A former history major who switched to film after losing faith in the academic life, Alan Taylor scored critical approval with his first feature, ""Palookaville"" (1995), about three young men in Jersey City, NJ, mired in great-rich-quick schemes. Made in association with American Playhouse, the film, which won the Kodak Award at the Venice Film Festival, owed its inspiration to short stories by Italian writer Italo Calvini as well as several classic films, notably ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" (1958). Taylor demonstrated his helming skills by negotiating the fine line between absurdist deadpan humor and realism, evoking fine performances from his cast. Eschewing showy camerawork and focusing on the story, the director created a film that featured believable characters, working-class men frustrated by their situations and the strong, independent females in their lives."
Alfonso Cuarón,
Anna Boden,"Born in Massachusetts, Anna Boden grew up with a love for movies. She took that fascination with the medium to college, when she attended Columbia University to study film. It was at Columbia that her eventual career would take shape. She met Ryan Fleck, an NYU Tisch student with a similar interest in the filmmaking. The pair hit it off, started dating, and more importantly, started making shorts and movies together. Their first collaborative project was ""Have You Seen This Man?"" (2003), a documentary short that they co-directed. Around that same time, the film school graduates were crafting their first feature-length script. To raise money and financing for the full-length film, they made ""Gowanus, Brooklyn"" (2004), a short film that made its way to the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. Unfortunately, the duo weren't successful in their goal right away. It took them nearly two more years to raise the money to make ""Half Nelson"" (2006), their Ryan Gosling-starring feature debut. ""Half Nelson"" was a critical darling, as Boden and Fleck made a splash at award shows with the film. Gosling even received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his work in their film. Their next work was ""Sugar"" (2008), a film about a young Dominican who immigrates to America to play baseball. While not as big of a hit as their previous work, ""Sugar"" once again drew critical and award buzz. Boden and Fleck worked with a studio for the first time next, adapting ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" (2010) from its young adult book origins into a coming-of-age comedy starring Zach Galifanakis. Following up on the relative success of ""It's Kind of a Funny Story,"" the pair took five years to produce their next film. That film, ""Mississippi Grind"" (2015), took them back to the path they carved out with ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar,"" though this time they had a much a bigger profile. ""Mississippi Grind"" starred Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendolsohn as two gamblers with a penchant for addiction and superstition."
Anthony Russo,"Successful summer blockbusters can sometimes come from the most innocent places. Anthony Russo, along with his brother and co-director Joe, carved a niche in directing cult TV shows and the occasional comedy movie. After working on shows such as ""Community"" (NBC 2009-14; Yahoo!, 2015) and ""Arrested Development"" (FOX 2003-2005, Netflix 2013), Russo and his brother were contacted by Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige to direct the blockbuster ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) despite never directing an action movie before. Feige had faith in the two brothers, and the faith paid off to an enormous box-office success with glowing reviews."
Armando Iannucci,"As one of the most significant voices in British comedy at the dawn of the 21st century, Armando Iannucci made a name for himself with his unique brand of witty political satire. After earning a degree in English Literature from Oxford, Iannucci followed his passion for comedy and entered the world of radio broadcasting with his show ""On the Hour,"" a satire of news programming. Iannucci helped develop several character for the show, most notably Steve Coogan's bumbling sports reporter Alan Partridge; the pair spun that character off into two television series, ""Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge"" (BBC 1994-95) and ""I'm Alan Partridge"" (BBC 1997-2002). After ""On the Hour"" spawned its own tremendously successful spin-off television series, ""The Day Today"" (BBC 1994), Iannucci found himself producing and writing several different television projects while keeping himself out of the limelight. But with his deeply personal and ambitiously experimental series ""The Armando Iannucci Shows"" (BBC 2001), Iannucci showed audiences what the world looked like through his eyes. Despite the show's low ratings in the wake of September 11, it helped land Iannucci his biggest and most critically-acclaimed project yet: the award-winning comedy series ""The Thick of It"" (BBC 2005-2012), a hilariously profane satire of British politics starring Peter Capaldi as spin doctor Malcolm Tucker. The show was such a success that Iannucci co-wrote and directed the Oscar-nominated satire ""In the Loop"" (2009) using the same characters in a political standoff with their counterparts in the United States. That success led to ""Veep"" (HBO 2012- ), another political satire, this time starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus as tone-deaf and hapless Vice President Selina Meyer. The series was an immediate critical and commercial success, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy for its fourth season after three consecutive nominations. While working on ""Veep,"" Iannucci revisited one of his most popular early characters, co-writing Coogan's big-screen return to Alan Partridge, ""Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa"" (2013)."
Barry Jenkins,
Bo Burnham,"Comedian Bo Burnham's uproarious - and sometimes uncomfortable - comedy songs made him a YouTube sensation while still in his teens, but unlike many of his social media peers, he parlayed the success into a critically acclaimed stand-up comedy career and a well-regarded debut as writer-director on the independent comedy-drama ""Eighth Grade"" (2018). Born Robert Pickering Burnham on August 21, 1990 in Hamilton, Massachusetts, he was the youngest of three children by construction company owner Scott Burnham and his wife, Patricia, who worked as a nurse. While a student at St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Masssachusetts, the teenaged Burnham began writing and performing satirical songs, including ""My Whole Family (Thinks I'm Gay)"" and ""Klan Kookout."" Though the topics were decidedly - and deliberately - outrageous and politically incorrect, Burnham's faux-wholesome delivery and button-down appearance, as well as the choice of his own bedroom and family as backdrop, did much to defang the potentially offensive nature of the material. He began posting the songs to YouTube and other social media sites in 2006, where they garnered millions of hits. Their popularity led to a contract with Comedy Central, which yielded his television debut at 18 on a segment of the 2008 special ""The World Stands Up"" and his self-titled debut comedy album in 2009. Writer-director Judd Apatow soon tapped him to collaborate on a parody of the popular ""High School Musical"" franchise (Disney Channel, 2004-07), and while the project did not come to fruition, Burhnam made his feature film debut with a cameo in Apatow's ""Funny People"" (2009). After recording his first one-hour comedy special, ""Bo Burnham: Words, Words, Words"" (Comedy Central, 2010), Burnham began work on developing a comedy series, ""Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous"" (MTV, 2013); the comedy, about a naïve teenager who sets out to become a celebrity despite his lack of discernable talent, debuted on MTV in 2013 but lasted only a season. Undaunted, Burnham returned to a steady schedule of touring and recording comedy albums and specials, including 2013's what. and 2016's ""Bo Burnham: Make Happy"" (Netflix), while also expanded his acting resume with supporting roles in the critically acclaimed ""The Big Sick"" (2017) and ""Rough Night"" (2017). The following year, he scored a personal and professional triumph by writing and directing ""Eighth Grade"" (2018). The comedy-drama, inspired by his own teenage years, followed a socially anxious teen (played by Elsie Fisher) as she navigated the emotional upheaval prior to high school through a series of comic advice vlogs. The film earned Burnham an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay and the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding First-Time Feature and Writers Guild Award for Best Original Screenplay. The success of the film led to a diverse array of assignments, from writing songs for a ""Sesame Street"" (PBS/HBO, 1969-  ) movie musical to acting in ""Promising Young Woman"" (2019) an ensemble drama starring Carey Mulligan for director Emerald Fennell (""Killing Eve,"" BBC America, 2016- )."
Bob Persichetti,"Bob Persichetti was an American animator, screenwriter, and director who helped bring many of the biggest animated films of the 21st century to life, before landing his big break with a groundbreaking take on the world's favorite web-slinging superhero. Persichetti began working in animation in 1997, acting as an inbetweener on ""Hercules"" (1997). He would continue to work at Disney for the next five years, assisting animators on such projects as ""Mulan"" (1998), ""Tarzan"" (1999), ""Fantastia 2000"" (1999), ""The Emperor's New Groove"" (2000), ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" (2001), and ""Treasure Planet"" (2002). During this time, with CGI animation on the rise, Disney's continued use of 2D cell animation was causing them to fall behind, and Persichetti soon decamped for the greener pastures of Dreamworks Animation, where he worked as a storyboard artist on ""Shrek 2"" (2004), ""Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" (2005), ""Flushed Away"" (2006), ""Shrek the Halls"" (2007), and ""Monsters and Aliens"" (2009). He was promoted to Head of Story for his next project, ""Puss in Boots"" (2015), a title he also held for Netflix's animated adaptation of ""The Little Prince"" (2015), which he co-wrote with screenwriter Irena Brignull. Persichetti got his big break when he was tapped alongside Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman to co-direct the first animated film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018). The film's psychedelic visuals, a combination of computer animation and hand-drawn comic book techniques, its inspirational good humor, and stellar voice cast (including Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, John Mulaney, and Nicolas Cage) wowed both critics and audiences, and the film won Best Animated Feature film at the 46th Annie Awards, the 76th Golden Globe Awards, the 24th Critics' Choice Awards, and the 72nd BAFTA Film Awards, plus a nomination in that category at the 91st Academy Awards."
Brad Bird,"Brad Bird was born Phillip Bradley Bird on Sept. 24, 1957 in Kalispell, MT. Bird's professional story is often said to have begun when, at age 11, he met Walt Disney Studios animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson during a tour of the studio. Having earned the animators' interest, Bird managed to get their eyes on an original animated short film that he completed two years later. By the time he was 14, Bird had become the protégée of Disney animator Milt Kahl; when it came time for Bird to pursue higher education, Disney awarded him a scholarship to the California Institute of the Arts. Following graduation, he began working for Disney as an animator. His early projects included the short film ""The Small One"" (1978) and the feature film ""The Fox and the Hound"" (1981), during production of which Bird was fired for a contentious relationship with upper management. From there, he leapt directly to the world of television, all the while maintaining footing in the film world with projects like ""*batteries not included"" (1987), which he co-wrote. Bird worked on ""Amazing Stories"" (NBC 1985-87), helped to develop ""The Simpsons"" (Fox 1989-), and worked on ""The Critic"" (ABC/Fox 1994-95) and ""King of the Hill"" (Fox 1997-2010). Bird made his feature directorial debut with the critically beloved ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), which earned him a job at the blossoming animation company Pixar, ultimately landing him back beneath the Disney umbrella. With the company, Brad directed and produced the ""The Incredibles"" (2004), an adventure film about a family of superheroes, and ""Ratatouille"" (2007), a comedy about a rat who works with a French chef to create gourmet meals. Next, he'd move into the world of live-action directing, helming ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), the fourth film in the ""Mission: Impossible"" film franchise. His next live-action effort, ""Tomorrowland"" (2015), would prove a critical and commercial disappointment, and Bird would return to animation thereafter. He directed ""Incredibles 2"" (2018), which ranked among the highest grossing animated films of all time."
Bradley Cooper,"Handsome and irreverently funny, Bradley Cooper's combination of romantic leading man and hilarious character actor chops helped him progress from TV guest spots to memorable parts in features in a relatively short amount of time. After attracting attention for his likable role as Jennifer Garner's reporter friend on ""Alias"" (ABC, 2001-06), Cooper fearlessly made his first major big screen impression as the unlikable groom in ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005). He regained audience's affection in lesser fare like ""Failure to Launch"" (2006) and, in testament to his charisma, emerged unscathed from Sandra Bullock's notorious bomb ""All About Steve"" (2008). Cooper ensured his own launch with the lead in the critical and box office juggernaut ""The Hangover"" (2009) and proved an invaluable member of the romantic, dramatic ensemble ""He's Just Not That Into You"" (2009) and ""Valentine's Day"" (2010) casts. Graduating to full-fledged stardom with a flashy role in ""The A-Team"" (2010), Cooper continued to rise as a bankable, talented and very much in-demand movie star, which was confirmed with a return to box-office prominence with ""The Hangover Part II"" (2011) and his star turn in David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012) opposite Jennifer Lawrence. That trio reunited twice more for ""American Hustle"" (2013) and ""Joy"" (2015), while Cooper continued starring in films ranging from Clint Eastwood's drama ""American Sniper"" (2014) to James Gunn's blockbuster action-comedy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) and its 2017 sequel, in which he provided the voice of Rocket, a raccoon-like mutant with serious anger management issues. Whether starring in comedies, thrillers or romantic dramas - as well as making a tabloid splash in the wake of rumored romances with some of Hollywood's loveliest leading ladies - Cooper propelled himself into becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars."
Brian DePalma,"Director Brian De Palma focused his creative efforts on making viscerally disturbing thrillers that were both stylish and violent. After emerging onto the scene with small independents like ""Greetings"" (1968) and ""The Wedding Party"" (1969), De Palma touched on Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1958) as inspiration for the thriller ""Obsession"" (1976). But he had one of his most lasting successes with ""Carrie"" (1976), an adaptation of Stephen King's first novel and a graphic horror thriller about teen cruelty that featured one of the most memorable uses of fake blood in cinema history.  Following ""The Fury"" (1978) and ""Dressed to Kill"" (1980), wherein he honed his signature stylistic flourishes, De Palma directed John Travolta in ""Blow Out"" (1981), one of his most critically regarded films. De Palma returned with renewed vigor and directed the film ""Scarface"" (1983), which originally earned an X-rating for its graphic violence, while later becoming a favorite among many filmgoers.  He followed with what many considered his best film, ""The Untouchables"" (1987), which was a successful blend of his usual cinematic styling with strong performances from its leading actors. The beginning of the decade saw him helm the challenging adaptation of Tom Wolfe's ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" (1990), while later directing the mega-successful ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), perhaps his most straightforward studio film. Though he triumphed with the critically lauded, but underappreciated ""Carlito's Way"" (1993), De Palma had less success with the likes of ""Snake Eyes"" (1998), ""Mission to Mars"" (2000) and ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006), all of which demonstrated his ability to combine great cinematic triumphs with lesser, but always intriguing, films."
Bridget Savage Cole,
Christopher McQuarrie,"As the childhood friend and frequent collaborator of director Bryan Singer, screenwriter and sometime helmer Christopher McQuarrie was catapulted to the upper echelons of the screenwriting world after winning the Oscar for the widely hailed noir thriller ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995). In breaking all the rules for screenwriting - mainly because he was unaware of them - McQuarrie redefined the crime-noir genre and became one of the most sought-after writers in the business. But such blessings came with a price after he was given the chance to direct his first feature, ""The Way of the Gun"" (2000), a graphic thriller that polarized audiences and critics on its way to becoming a box office failure. For the next seven plus years, McQuarrie was trapped in development hell on a number of movies that never made it to production, frustrating him to the point of wanting to quit the business altogether. But Singer managed to pull his old friend back in by directing McQuarrie's spec script for ""Valkyrie"" (2008), a World War II thriller about a Nazi plot to assassinate Hitler. From there, he wrote the scripts for two more critically derided films, ""Killshot"" (2009) and ""The Tourist"" (2010), but managed to earn praise for writing and directing the highly anticipated adaptation of ""Jack Reacher"" (2012) and ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" (2015). Whether behind the camera or the keyboard, McQuarrie's gift for telling unique stories and redefining genre tropes remained the one constant in his otherwise turbulent career."
Damien Chazelle,"The backbone and inspiration of many of Damien Chazelle's films was always his love of music, first seen in his black and white musical ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench."" Music then became the subject of his award-winning short--and then later feature--″Whiplash.�?Born in Rhode Island in 1985, Chazelle grew up in both France and America; his comfort with two cultures strongly informed his film work. He began his first film, a short entitled ″Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench�?(2009), as his thesis for his Masters at Harvard in Visual and Environmental Studies. Over the next two years, he developed it into a full length feature, utilizing friends and a 16mm camera to tell the story of a woman and a jazz musician. After graduation he moved out to Los Angeles with a plan to connect with the film studios through his work as a screenplay writer for hire. By 2009 he had taken ″Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench�?to festivals where it gained some notice and several awards including recognition as an emerging artist at the Denver International Film Festival and a Jury Special Prize at the Torino International Film Festival. He continued to hone his writing skills as a screenwriter in Hollywood and began to write his next feature, ″Whiplash�?(2013). This film was much more personal, an insider's dark look at the powerful emotions and obsessions that drive music students. As a former student at musical academies, it was a subject he knew quite well. When he found the script a tough sell, he listened to advice and took a scene from it to develop as a short film. The short created buzz across the 2013 film festival circuit and won numerous awards including the Short Film Jury Prize at Sundance. New interest in the original led to the feature-length script being included on the coveted ″Black List�?of unproduced films considered by studios. With this help, funding was secured and the feature-length film ″Whiplash�?was produced, winning awards and acclaim from Sundance to Cannes. Chazelle's next project moved even further into his love of music: ""La La Land"" (2016) was a full-fledged musical, with elaborate song and dance numbers throughout. Stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling did all their own singing and dancing as a struggling actress and idealistic jazz pianist. The critically acclaimed box office hit scored 14 Oscar nominations, tying the record set by ""All About Eve"" (1951) and ""Titanic"" (1997), and won six, including Best Original Score, Best Original Song (for the film's love theme ""City of Stars""), Best Director and Best Actress. In one of the most shocking moments in Oscar history, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced that ""La La Land"" had won Best Picture and producer Jordan Horowitz was most of the way through his acceptance speech before it was revealed that a mistake had been made: the true winner of the Best Picture award was indie drama ""Moonlight"" (2016)."
Dan Scanlon,
David Yates,
Denis Villeneuve,"As a multiple Genie Award winner, Canadian director Denis Villeneuve was at the helm of several critically-acclaimed films, including ""Maelström"" (2000) and ""Incendies"" (2010), before he began working in Hollywood with the tense moral drama ""Prisoners"" (2013) and his international breakthrough film, science-fiction drama ""Arrival"" (2016). A prolific director able to work in a wide variety of genres, Villeneuve was one of Francophone Canada's most compelling auteurs of his generation. Born in the southern Quebec suburb of Gentilly on October 3, 1967, Villeneuve was initially interested in science before he abandoned the laboratory and decided to pursue his love of movies. He studied film at the Université du Québec à Montréal and began his film career in his early twenties when he was credited as director for the television documentary ""La course destination monde"" (1988). Two years later, he entered Radio-Canada's youth film competition ""La Course Europe-Asie"" in 1990 and won. These early successes allowed him to earnestly pursue more film projects, albeit small, low-budget productions. Without any studio support, Villeneuve wrote and directed a short film titled ""REW-FFD"" (1994), followed by an anthology of six short films, ""Cosmos"" (1996), in which he directed the segment titled ""Le Technetium."" With a couple of short films under his belt, Villeneuve next tackled a feature. Written and directed by himself, ""Un 32 août sur terre"" (1998) was screened at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, where it was received positively. Villeneuve's next full-length feature, ""Maelström"" (2000), built upon his previous success and showed off his burgeoning talents. Once again written and directed by Villeneuve himself, ""Maelström"" was a drama about a depressed, alcoholic woman who falls in love with the son of a man whom she accidentally killed in a hit-and-run. The film was widely praised on the international film festival circuit, winning directorial awards for Villeneuve from the Vancouver Film Critics Circle and the Toronto International Film Festival. ""Maelström"" was also recognized several times at the Genie Awards -- Canada's equivalent to the Academy Awards -- including wins for Best Motion Picture and Best Director for Villeneuve. Nearly a decade later, the writer-director returned with the tense hostage drama ""Polytechnique"" (2009), based on a mass shooting that took place at a Montreal college in 1989. The Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television deemed ""Polytechnique"" the best Canadian film of the year, sweeping seven of the major awards at the 30th Genie Awards, including Villeneuve's second Best Director award. Unlike the long gap between Villeneuve's first and second features, he returned the following year with the sibling drama ""Incendies."" Once again, he claimed the Best Director Genie award, for the second consecutive year, but the film was also recognized internationally, including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film several more festival awards. With his international profile at its highest point yet, Villeneuve made a pair of films in quick succession, both featuring Hollywood star Jake Gyllenhaal. ""Enemy"" (2013) was an erotic thriller based on Portuguese author Jose Saramago's novel The Double. The more high-profile ""Prisoners"" (2013) was an American-backed film co-starring Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard as a pair of suburban neighbors whose daughters are abducted and Gyllenhaal as the detective investigating their disappearance. Both ""Prisoners"" and ""Enemy"" premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. His next film, drug war thriller ""Sicario"" (2015) was a major critical success that raised Villeneuve's American profile considerably. That led to his first major American studio film, the philosophical alien invasion story ""Arrival"" (2016) starring Amy Adams as a linguist attempting to communicate with aliens making first contact with Earth. The film scored eight Academy award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, but won only for Best Sound Editing. Villeneuve immediately capitalized on the film's success by helming science fiction reboot ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), which opened to uniformly rapturous reviews from both professional critics and social media tastemakers, and developing a new version of cult SF favorite ""Dune."""
Eliza Hittman,
George Miller,"A wildly imaginative Australian filmmaker, writer-director George Miller received critical and popular success in both live-action and animation over the course of several decades. After life as a medical doctor, Miller rose to critical acclaim as a filmmaker, thanks to his post-apocalyptic action movie ""Mad Max"" (1979), starring a then-unknown Aussie actor named Mel Gibson. But it was the much better sequel ""The Road Warrior"" (1980) that catapulted both director and star into international fame. From there, he directed Gibson in the studio-made sequel, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) and helmed the horror comedy ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1987), starring Jack Nicholson as Satan lusting after three lonely women. After producing ""Flirting"" (1991), Nicole Kidman's final Australian production before transitioning to Hollywood, Miller wrote and directed the acclaimed tearjerker ""Lorenzo's Oil"" (1992). He had one of his biggest critical and commercial hits with the endearing ""Babe"" (1995) and it's equally delightful sequel ""Babe: Pig in the City"" (1996), before winning the Oscar for Best Animated Film for his box-office smash ""Happy Feet"" (2006). Though he stumbled a bit with the inferior sequel ""Happy Feet Two"" (2011), Miller remained one of the more underappreciated, but successful filmmakers working in Hollywood."
Greta Gerwig,"A uniquely soulful screen presence in numerous independent films, including many in the pared-down, character-driven ""mumblecore"" scene, Greta Gerwig graduated to leading roles in major independent films like ""Frances Ha"" (2012), as well as her own acclaimed filmmaking career with ""Lady Bird"" (2018) and ""Little Women"" (2019).  Born Greta Celeste Gerwig in Sacramento, California on August 4, 1983, she and her two siblings were raised as Unitarian Universalists by their father, a loan officer at a credit union, and their mother, an OB-GYN nurse. Though interested in dance, Gerwig studied English at Barnard College, and decided to pursue a master's degree in playwriting. But after finding no purchase at MFA programs for that discipline, Gerwig turned to acting. She had already appeared in two films by seminal ""mumblecore"" filmmakers Joe Swanberg (2006's ""LOL"") and Jay and Mark Duplass (the meta-horror film ""Baghead,"" 2008). These experiences led to her own behind-the-scenes work with Swanberg, first as co-writer on ""Hannah Takes the Stars"" (2007) and later, as writer-director on ""Nights and Weekends"" (2008), a comedy about a romantically involved couple (Gerwig and Swanberg) who must overcome the challenges of a long-distance relationship. A natural performer with a gift for embodying the anxieties and pleasures inherent in the transition from college age to adulthood, Gerwig was soon courted by mainstream adjacent filmmakers like Noam Baumbach, who cast her as the assistant to an eccentric Hollywood family in ""Greenberg"" (2010), and later became her significant other. Though a box office failure, ""Greenberg"" and her work with the mumblecore scene led to work in Hollywood features: Gerwig was part of a complex love quadrangle with Jesse Eisenberg and Ellen Page in Woody Allen's ""To Rome with Love"" (2012), played Natalie Portman's best friend in Ivan Reitman's ""No Strings Attached"" (2011) and was pursued by boyish millionaire Russell Brand in the remake of ""Arthur"" (2011). But Gerwig also remained connected to her indie roots through performances in Whit Stillman's ""Damsels in Distress"" (2011) and drew critical praise for her turns as young women in various stages of personal collapse and reconstruction in ""Lola Versus"" (2011) and Baumbach's ""Frances Ha"" (2012), which she co-wrote, and which earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. After netting positive reviews for her stage debut in The Village Bike in 2014, Gerwig resumed her busy schedule of roles in independent features, including a turn as a gay woman who engages in a sexual relationship with aging actor Al Pacino in Barry Levinson's ""The Humbling"" (2015), a career woman whose desire to have a baby with a married man leads to complications in Rebecca Miller's ""Maggie's Plan"" (2015), and as the adult version of Heather Matarazzo's hapless Dawn Wiener in Todd Solondz's ""Wiener-Dog"" (2016), a sequel of sorts to his debut, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" (1995). After playing a photographer recovering from cancer in Mike Mills' autobiographical ""20th Century Women"" (2016), Gerwig wrote and directed ""Lady Bird"" (2017), a carefully crafted and painfully honest comedy-drama about an eclectic teenager with artistic ambitions and a challenging home life; the film earned near-universal acclaim, as well as a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, while Gerwig became the fifth woman in motion picture history to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. After voicing a character in Wes Anderson's animated ""Isle of Dogs"" (2018), Gerwig commenced on her next project as writer-director: an adaptation of ""Little Women"" (2019) which reunited her with her ""Lady Bird"" star, Saoirse Ronan. The film opened to universal acclaim on Christmas 2019."
Guillermo del Toro,"As part of the wave of Mexican filmmakers who have made an indelible mark upon American cinema in the 1990s, director Guillermo del Toro - along with compatriots Alejandro González Iñárritu, and Alfonso Cuarón - attained a remarkable level of critical and box-office success in an environment not conducive to international filmmaking. Unlike his peers, however, del Toro steered away from making art house films about his native Mexico, focusing instead on helming old-fashioned horror movies. Bursting onto the scene with his first effort, ""Cronos"" (1993), del Toro learned how to deal with Hollywood the hard way with his first studio effort, ""Mimic"" (1997). After directing ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), a return to independent film and his native Mexico, he took on Hollywood a second time with ""Blade II"" (2002), only this time with more success. His critically acclaimed adaptation of the comic book ""Hellboy"" (2004) was followed by the critically acclaimed ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006), a stark, but dream-like horror fantasy that earned three Academy Awards and helped to make del Toro a rare success in both the United States and his homeland. He went on to direct the successful sequel ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" (2008) while stepping into a producer's role for ""Biutiful"" (2010) and ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" (2011). Whether as a writer, director, producer and even novelist, del Toro drew upon an eclectic mix of horror, science fiction and fantasy to create unique and sometimes bizarre films that earned him a loyal following."
J.J. Abrams,"An inventive screenwriter and television producer who transformed himself into one of Hollywood's biggest feature directors, J.J. Abrams created some of television's most watched shows while simultaneously making huge blockbuster movies. Though he had a rather inauspicious start writing the scripts for ""Taking Care of Business"" (1990) and ""Regarding Henry"" (1991), Abrams made his first dent in the cultural zeitgeist with the hit drama ""Felicity"" (The WB, 1998-2002). Abrams truly began making his mark with the spy drama ""Alias"" (ABC, 2001-06), which turned lead actress Jennifer Garner into a star and helped resurrect a foundering ABC network. He went on to help create the cult phenomenon ""Lost"" (ABC, 2004-2010), a mysterious sci-fi thriller wrapped inside a stirring character drama that attracted a loyal audience, all of whom tried to decipher the previous night's episode. When he left the series during the height of its run, Abrams ventured into feature film directing with the well-received ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006). He also paid homage to the classic '80s films of his hero Steven Spielberg with ""Super 8"" (2011), which audiences and critics hailed as one of Abrams' most engaging efforts in a career already rife with crowd-pleasing entertainment. It was his reboot of the famed franchise ""Star Trek"" (2009) that launched his blockbuster career in earnest and foretold of even greater things to come, including the 2013 announcement that he landed the coveted director's job on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), which went on to overtake ""Avatar"" (2009) as the highest-grossing film in history (not adjusted for inflation). In September 2017, Abrams' return to the Star Wars universe was confirmed when it was announced that he would replace the departing Colin Trevorrow as writer and director of 2019's ""Star Wars Episode IX."""
James Gunn,
James Mangold,"Though he almost gave up trying to make it in Hollywood after being fired by Disney from his first gig, writer-director James Mangold re-emerged from a short hiatus with his acclaimed feature debut, ""Heavy"" (1995), which brought him industrywide recognition. Mangold followed up with the critical darling ""Cop Land"" (1997), which earned him a reputation as a practitioner of hard-hitting and gritty independent films. After helping make Angelina Jolie a star with ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999), the director began to slip a little with critics when he helmed the Meg Ryan romantic comedy ""Kate & Leopold"" (2001). But once again, Mangold surprised his critics with the deft supernatural thriller ""Identity"" (2003), while receiving a ton of critical kudos for his popular biopic ""Walk the Line"" (2005), which brought about renewed interest in the music of outlaw country star Johnny Cash. With the remake of the Western ""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007) and Tom Cruise action comedy ""Knight and Day"" (2010), Mangold demonstrated that he was comfortable directing any genre he chose. He brought that eclectic sensibility to the superhero universe, directing two tonally very different films starring Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, ""The Wolverine"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017)."
Joe Johnston,"Despite having received his start in film as a part of George Lucas' famed visual effects team on ""Star Wars"" (1977), and eventually directing several high-profile movies himself, Joe Johnston somehow managed to keep a remarkably low-profile during much of his career. Originally intending to pursue a career in industrial design, Johnston's professional path took an unexpected turn when he answered an ad looking for illustrators to work on a new science fiction movie. That movie turned out to be ""Star Wars,"" and from there Johnston worked as a visual effects director on that film's two sequels, in addition to similar duties on Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). Encouraged by Lucas to try his hand at directing, Johnston enrolled in the University of Southern California's filmmaking program, although he continued to work on various Lucas/Spielberg projects. Shortly thereafter, Johnston was hired by Disney Studios to direct his first feature film, ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989). Family-friendly material, filled with special effects became Johnston's stock in trade, exemplified by films like ""The Rocketeer"" (1991) and ""Jumamji"" (1995). Even as he made a name for himself as a director, Johnston continued to help fellow filmmakers with visual design work, including creating the initial drawing of the massive automaton for director Brad Bird's ""The Iron Giant"" (1999). He also managed to deliver a more personal film with the acclaimed ""October Sky"" (1999), before helming the special effects blockbuster ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001). Johnston endured a few misfires, taking the reins of the horseracing epic ""Hildalgo"" (2004) prior to landing the thankless task of salvaging the cursed remake ""The Wolfman"" (2010). As a filmmaker, Johnston's legacy would be that of a competent director, perhaps too reliant upon visual wizardry. However, as an unsung hero and creative force on some of the most beloved movies of all time, Joe Johnston's lasting impact on cinema was already assured."
Joe Russo,"Successful summer blockbusters can sometimes come from the most innocent places. Joe Russo, along with his brother and co-director Anthony, first made their names by directing cult TV shows and the occasional low-budget indie comedy. After working on shows such as ""Community"" (NBC 2009-15; Yahoo!, 2015) and ""Arrested Development"" (FOX 2003-2005, Netflix 2013- ), Russo and his brother were contacted by Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige to direct ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) despite never directing an action movie before. Feige had faith in the two brothers, and the faith paid off to a big box-office success that also garnered considerable critical acclaim."
John Krasinski,"As the bright, but beleaguered Jim Halpert on NBC's hit comedy ""The Office"" (2005-2013), actor John Krasinski struck the fancy of both viewers and critics alike with his boyish antics and one-of-a-kind facial expressions, usually directed straight at the camera. As one of the few sane employees in the workplace asylum known as Dunder-Mifflin, Krasinski's Halpert was often forced to deal with such day-to-day challenges as the boredom of his hum-drum existence, the demands of an annoyingly needy boss (Steve Carell) and lastly, a crush on co-worker Pam (Jenna Fisher) that captured the public's attention until the characters actually dated and later married. Prior to his ""Office"" stardom, Krasinski had a handful of minor feature roles while logging episodes of popular shows like ""Without a Trace"" (CBS, 2002-09) and ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" (NBC, 2001-2011). Because of his success, he landed roles in the features ""Leatherheads"" (2008), ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" (2009) and ""Something Borrowed"" (2011), which increased his profile. As he branched out into writing and directing with ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"" (2009), ""The Promised Land"" (2012) and ""The Hollars"" (2015), Krasinski allowed himself the opportunity to bring his Everyman charm to a much wider audience."
John Woo,
Jon Favreau,"Actor, producer, writer and director Jon Favreau hit unlikely pay dirt when ""Swingers"" (1996), his low-budget, autobiographical indie about struggling young actors, turned he and co-star/real-life best friend Vince Vaughn into hot property seemingly overnight. Favreau parlayed his rising profile into a number of supporting big-screen roles as cynical side men, but he was more anxious to get behind the camera and direct bigger features. After another indie buddy comedy with Vaughn, mob farce ""Made"" (2001), Favreau went wide with the holiday hit ""Elf"" (2003), starring a spandex-clad Will Ferrell. His acclaimed adaptation of the kids book ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) missed the mark with audiences, but his 2008 adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Iron Man"" starring Robert Downey, Jr. was one of the most anticipated action films of the year, leading to a return to leading man status for Downey, Jr. and hard-won blockbuster credentials for its highly creative director. Along with continuing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a producer and actor (playing Tony Stark's personal assistant Happy Hogan), Favreau found further success as a director through films as varied as the romantic comedy-drama ""Chef"" (2014) and the CGI blockbusters ""The Jungle Book"" (2016) and ""The Lion King"" (2019)."
Jon Watts,"Born and raised in the small town of Fountain, Colorado, Jon Watts turned to making short videos before he graduated from high school. His creative output led to a scholarship to attend New York University. After graduating, Watts joined Park Pictures, a production company making music videos, internet content, and short films. One of these was a trailer for ""Clown"" (2014), a horror film they claimed was directed by Eli Roth. Roth's popularity generated interest in the trailer, eventually from Roth himself, who contacted Watts and his friends and helped get the funding to make the film. Released four years after the initial trailer was made, the film was also written by Watts and his friend Christopher Ford. Watts and Ford again collaborated on the script for ""Cop Car"" (2015), with Watts directing Kevin Bacon as a bad cop who crosses paths with a couple of unfortunate kids. The film was roundly applauded by filmgoers and critics and brought him to the attention of executives at Marvel, who were looking for someone to bring a vision to the next iteration of ""Spider-Man."" Watts, again collaborating with Ford on the script, got the call and directed ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" (2017). The film was largely praised by critics and fans alike, who cheered the successful reimagining of a classic super hero. In 2017 it was announced that Watts would direct a sequel to the film."
Jordan Peele,"Actor-writer Jordan Peele gleefully skewered issues of race and popular culture as a solo performer and in tandem with his frequent partner Keegan-Michael Key on ""MADtv"" (Fox 1995-2009) and ""Key & Peele"" (Comedy Central 2012-15). A veteran of the Second City improvisational group, Peele broke into television with ""MADtv,"" which earned him widespread praise for celebrity impersonations and unhinged recurring characters. After netting a 2008 Emmy nomination for writing the comic music video ""Sad Fitty Cent,"" Peele left ""MAD"" to work on other series before reteaming with Key for their own show. ""Key & Peele"" was both a critical and audience favorite thanks to the stars' take on racially tinged subjects, including a supremely formal President Barack Obama (played by Peele). The popularity of the series led to additional high-profile opportunities for the stars and underscored both Key and Peele's ascent to the higher echelons of the comedy business. That success led to the duo's first big-screen effort, the action comedy ""Keanu"" (2016), in which the pair took on a violent street gang over a stolen kitten. In a somewhat unexpected shift of direction, Peele's first high-profile solo gig was the horror film ""Get Out"" (2017), which he wrote and directed; a racially-charged satirical film in the tradition of ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) and ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975), ""Get Out"" was a major critical and commercial success that poised Peele for a career apart from his longtime friend and partner."
Josh Cooley,
Joss Whedon,
Kenneth Branagh,"Once hailed as the ""new Laurence Olivier,"" Shakespearean-trained actor and director Kenneth Branagh struggled throughout his career to balance his near-obsessive drive to work with the need for a somewhat normal, settled life. After his directorial breakthrough with his interpretation of The Bard's ""Henry V"" (1989), Branagh had what appeared to many to be the picture-perfect life: a beautiful wife in Emma Thompson, a thriving career - thanks to his deft thriller ""Dead Again"" (1991) - and a reputation replete with an air of seriousness and unerring artistic credibility. But on the inside, Branagh claimed to have been going a bit mad, a realization exacerbated by his separation from Thompson and the debacle of ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1995). Later in life, he learned how to relax every now and then, but continued to push himself to greater artistic heights, sometimes to the point of failure, as with ""Hamlet"" (1996) and ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (2000). He rebounded, however, with a marvelous performance as a young Franklin Delano Roosevelt in ""Warm Springs"" (HBO, 2005), followed by an acclaimed turn as a brilliant but dysfunctional detective in the ""Wallander"" (PBS, 2009) miniseries and a return to the director's chair for the superhero smash ""Thor"" (2011), live-action fantasy ""Cinderella"" (2015) and cozy murder mystery ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017). With his heralded body of work as an actor, writer and director, Branagh had long emerged from Olivier's shadow to be recognized as one of the more formidable filmmakers of his generation."
Kenneth Lonergan,"Known for his insightful character studies and unique ability to draw real drama out of the outwardly mundane, writer-director Kenneth Lonergan boasted a career that was, in many ways, both impressive and surprising. After attracting significant early attention as a member of New York's Naked Angels theater company with his acerbic and insightful comedy-drama ""This is Our Youth"" in 1996, Lonergan earned his first screen credit as one of writers on the Robert De Niro-Billy Crystal hit comedy ""Analyze This"" (1999). After taking on a purely mercenary writing assignment for the film adaptation of ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" (2000), Lonergan displayed his true passion and understated talent with the low-key, but impactful family drama ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000). The film went on to earn widespread acclaim and helped launch the film career of longtime Lonergan friend and collaborator, Mark Ruffalo. Further stage works like 2000's ""The Waverly Gallery"" and script contributions to Martin Scorsese's sweeping ""Gangs of New York"" (2002) solidified the consensus that he was indeed an artist to watch. And then, nothing, until his sophomore feature film effort - filmed in 2005 - ""Margaret"" (2011) was given a limited release six years later, due to a bitter dispute between the writer-director and the studio over the movie's running time. Any bad feeling from that experience were likely swept away by the reception afforded his next film, the searing family drama ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016), a commercial and critical success that brought Lonergan the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as well as a Best Actor award for leading man Casey Affleck. While not the most prolific filmmaker of his generation, audiences could always count on a thought-provoking look at the lives of identifiable characters in any Lonergan offering."
Lee Unkrich,
Leigh Whannell,"Australian actor, screenwriter and producer Leigh Whannell is best known-some might say notorious-for his horror collaborations with director James Wan, most notably the original ""Saw"" (2004) and the ""Insidious"" films. After a few Aussie TV roles in his youth, he appeared briefly in the sci-fi sequel ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) and became intent on writing his own film with Wan. The result was the bloody and unexpected hit ""Saw,"" which made a huge return on its small budget, prompting a slew of sequels. Whannell co-penned ""Saw II"" (2005) and ""Saw III"" (2006) and served as an executive producer on the films. He later moved on to co-writing ""Dead Silence"" (2007) with Wan, but the movie wasn't successful critically or commercially. In 2010, Whannell and his go-to collaborator reunited for the supernatural film ""Insidious."" The eerie and unsettling tale, which featured Whannell as a paranormal investigator's assistant, was a huge hit. In 2013, he returned for ""Insidious: Chapter 2,"" which was well received, and once again showcased his clear talents as both a screenwriter and supporting actor."
Lulu Wang,"Lulu Wang was a Chinese-American filmmaker whose widely anticipated second feature film, ""The Farewell,"" was released in July of 2019. Wang was born in Beijing, China and lived there with her family when she was a young girl. At the age of 6, Wang moved with her parents to Miami, Florida. She would remain in the Sunshine State throughout her formative years. Encouraged by her parents, Wang began taking piano lessons at the age of 4 and quickly showed promise. She attended the prestigious New World School of the Arts in Miami for piano performance and showed immediate promise as a classical pianist. When it came time to enter college Wang was accepted into Boston College. She doubled majored in literature and music at the school, and went on to graduate in 2005. Although music had been one of her main focuses throughout her life, Wang longed to be making films. So after graduation she packed her bags and headed west to Hollywood. While living and working as a film producer's intern in L.A., Wang met fellow filmmaking aspirant Bernadette Burgi. The two hit it off and before long decided to start their own production company - Flying Box Productions. With Burgi serving as producer, Wang released her directorial debut with 2014's ""Posthumous."" That film, which starred Brit Marling and Jack Huston, was written and directed by Wang. Wang's follow-up film, ""The Farewell,"" premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The film starred Awkwafina as a young Chinese-American woman who travels to China to visit her dying grandmother. ""The Farwell"" was released theatrically in the U.S. in July of 2019."
Michael Showalter,"Shortly after leaving his hometown of Princeton, New Jersey to attend New York University, Michael Showalter quickly found his crew. He met up with like-minded budding comedians including David Wain, Thomas Lennon and Michael Ian Black and formed the comedy group The State. Even though Showalter wound up transferring to Brown University, he still remained close with his friends at The State, as he was a part of the gang's big break in 1993, when they started sketch comedy show ""The State"" (MTV 1993-95). While the show was short-lived, it kicked off Showalter's career. Throughout the rest of the '90s, Showalter appeared in small roles in film and TV before he worked with Wain to write cult classic ""Wet Hot American Summer"" (2001), which he also starred in. He followed that with another barrage of small roles, including a guest role on ""Sex and the City"" (HBO 1998-2004). He made his directorial debut with ""The Baxter"" (2005), and also returned to TV regularly with ""Stella"" (Comedy Central 2005), another comedy show also starring Wain and Black. For the next few years, Showalter focused more on his stand-up career, releasing a comedy album and going on tour with Black, Janeane Garofalo, and more. He returned to Comedy Central with the metafictional sitcom ""Michael and Michael Have Issues"" (Comedy Central 2009), which also starred Black. In 2014, Showalter worked with Wain on the Paul Rudd-starring romantic comedy parody ""They Came Together"" (2014), and wrote and directed his first dramatic feature, the Sally Field-starring ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" (2015). The following year, Showalter and Wain brought together the cast of their first big movie to create the eight-part prequel ""Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp"" (Netflix 2015)."
Olivia Wilde,"Olivia Wilde was an American actress and director who, in addition to appearing in ""TRON: Legacy"" (2010), ""Her"" (2013), and as Dr. Remy ""Thirteen"" Hadley on Fox's medical drama ""House"" (Fox, 2004-2012), also made her directing debut in 2019 with the critically-acclaimed high school comedy ""Booksmart"" (2019). Although Wilde was born in New York City, she was raised in both the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. and in Ireland. Her parents were respected journalists, so Wilde, who was born with the surname Cockburn, grew up in a household that was always booming with the intellectual banter of politicians, writers, and thinkers. When she was in her teens, the then Olivia Cockburn started going by the stage surname of Wilde. This was both to pay homage of the legendary Irish writer Oscar Wilde, as well as to honor the many writers in her family. A standout student, Wilde was accepted to Bard College but deferred enrollment a number of time to pursue an acting career. She eventually went on to study the craft at the Gaeity School of Acting in Dublin. By this time, Wilde held dual citizenships in both the United States and in Ireland. After receiving her formal training, Wilde began nabbing recurring TV roles. She appeared in 6 episodes of the short-lived Fox drama ""Skin"" (Fox, 2003-04), and went on to earn somewhat of a public following for her role as Alex Kelly on the teen drama ""The O.C."" (Fox, 2003-07). By the mid- to late-2000s, Wilde was appearing in a number of films, including ""Alpha Dog"" (2006), ""Year One"" (2009), and ""TRON: Legacy."" In 2007 she also landed her breakout TV role a recurring role on the Fox medical drama ""House."" Wilde played Dr. Remy ""Thirteen"" Hadley on the Golden Globe-winning series from 2007 to 2012. After ""House"" ended in 2012, Wilde continued nabbing parts in films like ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (2013), ""Rush,"" ""The Longest Week"" (2014), and ""Meadowland."" In 2016 she nabbed a part on the highly-anticipated period music drama ""Vinyl"" (HBO, 2016), but HBO cancelled the series after a single season. After 15 years as a working actress in Hollywood, Wilde decided to get behind the camera in 2019 by making her directorial debut with the high school comedy ""Booksmart."" That film, which starred Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, premiered to rave reviews in May of 2019. 2019 was also the year that Wilde starred in the Clint Eastwood-directed biographical drama ""Richard Jewell"" (2019). The film, which was released in December of that year, was about the security guard of the same name who was wrongly accused of the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta."
Patty Jenkins,"As an assistant cameraperson for over six years, writer-director Patty Jenkins learned the ropes of the entertainment industry the hard way: through long hours of toil. But unlike most first time directors, Jenkins knew the ins and outs of working on set before directing her first feature, ""Monster"" (2003), the true-life story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute executed in 2002 in Florida after being convicted of murdering six men. Despite her inexperience as a director, Jenkins elicited a bravura performance from her lead actress, Charlize Theron, who created a tremendous amount of Oscar buzz. Jenkins grew up in Kansas with Beat Generation heavies William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg as neighbors. A young Jenkins spent much of her spare time at the local cinema where she saw all kinds of movies. Though she later considered this her ""film education"", it never occurred to her at the time to be a filmmaker. After high school, Jenkins attended Cooper's Union in New York to study painting, but quickly traded her brushes for a camera package. Jenkins spent the next six years as a cameraperson on commercials and music videos for directors Tarsem and Brett Ratner. After this period, Jenkins moved to Los Angeles to attend the American Film Institute's Directing Program, where she made five short films that ranged in genre and form, including the female superhero short, ""Velocity Rules"" (2001). The short was selected to be shown at the 2001 AFT Fest. It was because of her entry into the AFI Fest that Jenkins was able to pitch her story about Wuornos, the first female serial killer to be executed in the state of Florida. Manager Brad Wyman liked the pitch and signed on to produce. Though they barely able to crack seven figures with the budget, Jenkins managed to score top talent to play her main character. In fact, Theron waived her usual fee in exchange for a producing credit, and later put up her own money for finishing costs. Meanwhile, Jenkins contacted Wuornos on death row in order to make sure that she would tell the story as accurately as possible-a result of the tabloid-style journalists who labeled Wuornos a monster fit to be killed. Wuornos was executed during pre-production, an event that strengthened Jenkins's resolve to tell her story in the most realistic and honest way as possible. The result of her hard efforts was a film that was hailed all around the festival circuit: it was nominated for three 2004 Independent Spirit Awards, and was voted one of the 10 best films of 2003 by the American Film Institute. Meanwhile, critics heaped praise on Theron, who became a top contended for an Oscar nod. Not bad for someone who just a few years ago didn't consider a career in filmmaking. Jenkins moved to television next, directing the made for TV film ""Five"" (Lifetime 2011) as well as the pilots for the mystery series ""The Killing"" (AMC 2011-13; Netflix, 2014) and ""Betrayal"" (ABC 2013-14). In April 2015, it was announced that Jenkins would replace original director Michelle MacLaren on the big-budget comic book film ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), which opened to enormously positive reviews and box office returns."
Pete Docter,
Peter Ramsey,"Director Peter A. Ramsey used his artistic talents to build a career in animation that found him gaining a legion of fans for his fresh take on a beloved superhero. A native of Los Angeles, after college he began working as a storyboard artist for a number of films, including ""Predator 2"" (1990), ""Backdraft"" (1991), ""Independence Day"" (1996). He also worked as a second unit director for John Singleton on ""Poetic Justice"" (1993) and ""Higher Learning"" (1995). He began working in animation as a storyboard artist for the Will Smith vehicle ""Shark Tale"" (2004). The relationship with that film's studio, DreamWorks, proved fruitful when he was selected to direct the television special ""Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins From Outer Space"" (NBC, 2009). He stepped up to directing features with ""Rise of the Guardians"" (2012) about mythological characters banding together to stop an evil force. The film earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Animated Feature Film. He continued lending his artistic talents to other films while also developing what would become his breakout project. Along with Rodney Rothman and Bob Persichetti, he took the reigns of an animated feature built around Marvel's Spider-Man. Instead of focusing strictly on original alter-ego Peter Parker, the story looked at a group of other characters from the comics who had worn the web-slinging costume. The resulting ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018) earned critical raves for its visually arresting style and sly humor. The film went on to win a Golden Globe and earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature Film."
Peyton Reed,"Peyton Reed could thank fellow filmmaker Edgar Wright for his big break. After a long established deal that would have had Wright-the writer/director behind ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (2010)-adapting the Ant-Man comic to screen for Marvel Studios was nullified due to creative differences, Reed was brought in to fill his shoes on the production. Having cut his teeth on studio comedies like ""Bring It On"" (2000), ""The Break-Up"" (2006), and ""Yes-Man"" (2008), Reed was deemed an amenable choice for Marvel and Disney's ""Ant-Man"" (2015) picture: his first true step toward blockbuster moviemaking. Peyton Reed was born on July 4, 1964, in Raleigh, North Carolina. He'd remain in state throughout his academic tenure, attending University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he worked in UNC Student Television and played deejay for college radio station WXYC. Following graduation, Reed began working a variety of jobs on Hollywood productions, serving in the transportation department for films like ""Bull Durham"" (1988) and the comedy ""Two Idiots in Hollywood"" (1988), and in the art department for ""Night Life"" (1989) and ""Easy Wheels"" (1989). His first steady directing job came on the short-lived television adaptation of ""Back to the Future"" (CBS 1991-92), which begat further TV work like ""The Weird Al Show"" (CBS 1997) and ""Upright Citizens Brigade"" (Comedy Central 1998-2000). Reed's first feature was ""Bring It On"" (2000), the cult hit cheerleading comedy that helped kick off the film careers of Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku. His following films did not leave quite the same mark ""Bring It On"" did on pop culture, though both the Vince Vaughn/Jennifer Aniston rom-com ""The Break-Up"" (2006) and the Jim Carrey comedy ""Yes Man"" (2008) did substantially better at the box office than the high school favorite. In 2014, Reed was roped in to replace director Edgar Wright on the developing Marvel Studios movie ""Ant-Man"" (2015), which opened to solid reviews and impressive box-office."
Quentin Tarantino,"The career of Quentin Tarantino instantly became the stuff of Hollywood legend, thanks to winning an Oscar, Golden Globe and numerous critics' awards for Best Original Screenplay for the groundbreaking and much-imitated ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). Having famously learned his art while working as a video store clerk after dropping out of high school, Tarantino burst onto the scene first as a writer, penning the original drafts of Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" (1993) and Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994). Prior to that, he was a cause célèbre at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival with his breakout heist-gone-wrong thriller ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). But it was ""Pulp Fiction"" that caught the attention of Hollywood, with the entertainment press selecting him - for better or worse - as the symbol of a new generation of hot, young directors. Tarantino followed up with the critically hailed ""Jackie Brown"" (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, and the epic martial arts flicks ""Kill Bill vol. 1"" (2003) and ""Kill Bill vol. 2"" (2004). After helming the ""Death Proof"" featurette in ""Grind House"" (2007), his gory collaboration with friend Robert Rodriguez, Tarantino returned to his Oscar-caliber ways with World War II fantasia ""Inglorious Basterds"" (2009), revenge epic ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ultraviolent western ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015). Regardless of what his harshest critics might have said, Tarantino remained a true auteur able to make his own films in an otherwise restrictive Hollywood system."
Richard Linklater,"Following his emergence into the spotlight with ""Slacker"" (1990), writer-director Richard Linklater was cited by many filmmakers and critics as having helped usher in the independent film movement of the 1990s.  Without his manifesto for Generation X - who later were tagged with the sobriquet ""slackers"" - other independent filmmakers might not have been compelled to make their own movies, including Kevin Smith, who cited Linklater's movie as the key inspiration for making ""Clerks"" (1994). Linklater followed up with the classic cult comedy, ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993), which upped the ante for the young filmmaker. Though at this point he could have gone the studio route, Linklater instead chose to remain close to his indie roots with the dialogue-heavy ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), an engrossing romantic drama that showcased his growing maturity. He managed to repel a few fans with the dark and disturbing ""subUrbia"" (1996) and the more genre-oriented period crime drama ""The Newton Boys"" (1998), only to pull them back with ""Waking Life"" (2001), a groundbreaking film that used distinctive rotoscope animation over live action sequences. After the equally inspired ""Tape"" (2001), he directed the financial hit ""School of Rock"" (2003), before returning to familiar ground with the follow-up ""Before Sunset"" (2004). By the time he helmed ""Fast Food Nation"" (2006) and ""A Scanner Darkly"" (2006), Linklater had proven that he could balance the needs of commerce with his own unique creative impulses."
Ruben Fleischer,"Just when it seemed as if nothing more could be done with zombies, the walking dead, or the aftermath of an apocalypse, Ruben Fleischer's ""Zombieland,"" from a script by Paul Wernick and Rhet Reese, reinvigorated the seemingly exhausted genre with an irreverent road comedy, complete with self-referential humor and surprising guest stars, all while retaining the outrageous violence of its predecessors. Modestly budgeted, it was met with largely positive reviews and strong word of mouth, eventually becoming the highest-grossing zombie movie of all time, surpassing even Zack Snyder's 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake. Fleischer, who cut his teeth directing ads for brands such as Burger King and Cisco, and music videos for artists such as M.I.A. and Electric Six, reteamed with ""Zombieland"" star and newly-minted Best Actor Oscar nominee Jesse Eisenberg for ""30 Minutes or Less,"" an action comedy about a slacker pizza delivery driver who is forced to rob a bank, under the threat of a set of explosives that have been rigged to his body. Rare for a director working in Hollywood, Fleischer didn't actually study film in an academic setting, instead earning a history degree from Wesleyan University and working for a brief period as an HTML programmer in San Francisco. He landed a Production Assistant post on the WB series ""Dawson's Creek,"" where his friendship with Mike White (""Chuck & Buck, The Good Girl"") enabled him to lay the foundation of his career, which ultimately led to directing."
Ryan Coogler,"Ryan Coogler was an American director who found success early in his career with short films and his lauded feature-length film debut ""Fruitvale Station"" (2013) before going on to become one of the most commercially successful black filmmakers in history. Ryan Coogler was born on May 23, 1986 in Oakland, California. His mother was a community organizer, and his father was a probation officer. Coogler was an athletic child, and he attended Saint Mary's College of California on a football scholarship. There, he studied chemistry, though a professor encouraged him to look into screenwriting. Coogler transferred, eventually landing at the USC School Of Cinematic Arts. There, he began directing award-winning short films, which centered on true-to-life and often harrowing tales. Starting at age 21, Coogler worked with at-risk youth, following in his father's footsteps by working in the prison system. His next cinematic venture was ""Fruitvale,"" a feature-length film about the last 24 hours of Oscar Grant's life before he was shot by policemen in Coogler's hometown of Oakland in a manslaughter case that had gone mostly overlooked by the public. The film, renamed ""Fruitvale Station,"" starred Michael B. Jordan, Melonie Diaz, and Octavia Spencer, and Forest Whitaker was one of the producers. After winning much praise and many awards at Sundance and Cannes, it was released by The Weinstein Company to popular and critical success. In 2014, Coogler signed on to direct ""Creed,"" a ""Rocky"" spin-off also starring Michael B. Jordan.  Its critical and commercial success led to the biggest film of Coogler's career so far, ""Black Panther"" (2018). The first film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe to focus on a black lead character  with a majority-black cast, the film was not only a massive commercial success, it was hailed as a major move forward for African-American filmmakers in general."
Ryan Fleck,"Ryan Fleck, born in California in 1976, pursued his filmmaking dream across the country, as he attended the prestigious Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. For his thesis at Tisch, he worked on a short film called ""Struggle"" (2002) that was his debut as a writer and director. Around that same time, he met Anna Boden, a Columbia film student with a similar interest in filmmaking. The pair hit it off, started dating, and more importantly, started making shorts and movies together. Their first collaborative project was ""Have You Seen This Man?"" (2003), a documentary short that they co-directed. Around that same time, the film school graduates were crafting their first feature-length script. To raise money and financing for the full-length film, they made ""Gowanus, Brooklyn"" (2004), a short film that made its way to the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. Unfortunately, the duo weren't successful in their goal right away. It took them nearly two more years to raise the money to make ""Half Nelson"" (2006), their Ryan Gosling-starring feature debut. ""Half Nelson"" was a critical darling, as Boden and Fleck made a splash at award shows with the film. Gosling even received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his work in it. Their next work was ""Sugar"" (2008), a film about a young Dominican who immigrates to America to play baseball. While not as big of a hit as their previous work, ""Sugar"" was successful, once again drawing critical and award buzz. Boden and Fleck worked with a studio for the first time next, adapting ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" (2010) from its young adult book origins into a coming-of-age comedy starring Zach Galifanakis. Following up on the relative success of ""It's Kind of a Funny Story,"" the pair took five years to produce their next film. That film, ""Mississippi Grind"" (2015), took them back to the path they carved out with ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar,"" though with a much bigger profile. ""Mississippi Grind"" starred Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn as two gamblers with a penchant for addiction and superstition."
Sam Mendes,"Because of his highly technical and visual theater productions in London and on Broadway, Sam Mendes made a smooth transition to film with ""American Beauty"" (1999), which earned him an Academy Award for his directing debut. Previous to his Oscar triumph, Mendes enjoyed a long and very successful career in theater, directing acclaimed and visually stunning productions of William Shakespeare's ""The Tempest,"" Tennessee Williams' ""The Glass Menagerie,"" and Lionel Bart's popular musical ""Oliver!"" But it was his 1998 revival of ""Cabaret"" that attracted the attention of Hollywood - specifically Mendes fan Steven Spielberg, which led to the stage veteran directing his first feature. Following a few aborted film efforts and a triumphant return to theatre, Mendes returned to celluloid with the elaborate, lavish ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), which displayed some of the promise of his sterling debut, but ultimately failed to warm many hearts. Nonetheless, he maintained a steady output on stage and on screen, directing the Iraq War drama ""Jarhead"" (2005) and '50s period piece ""Revolutionary Road"" (2008), which starred his then-wife, Kate Winslet. Mendes took a huge commercial leap forward as the director of the 23rd and 24th James Bond films, ""Skyfall"" (2012) and ""Spectre"" (2015), which brought new emotional depth to the long-running series while confirming his status as an intelligent and deliberate filmmaker capable of crafting deeply resonant films."
Scott Derrickson,"Writer/director Scott Derrickson gave America nightmares with a series of slick scary movies. Seeing that so many of his films deal with the nature of good and evil, god and the devil, it should come as no surprise that Derrickson studied theology alongside literature, philosophy and film at Biola University, CA, a university known for its evangelical Christian viewpoint. Moving to the USC School of Cinematic Arts to study film production, Derrickson made his mark directing and co-writing (with regular collaborator Paul Harris Boardman) the short ""Love in Ruins"" (1995). His next project was as writer on slasher sequel ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" (2000) before taking his first trip to hell writing and directing ""Hellraiser: Inferno"" (2000) the fifth installment in the long running horror franchise. After working with Wim Wenders on ""Land of Plenty"" (2004), Derrickson's first breakout hit was as director on ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" (2005), once again co-written with Boardman. This lead to Derrickson directing the big budget remake of sci-fi classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008) starring Keanu Reeves. Despite generally bad reviews, it still claimed the number one spot at the American box-office on opening weekend and went onto earn over $230 million worldwide. However it was a return to the supernatural with the deeply creepy ""Sinister"" (2012) which saw Derrickson pick up fans and critical plaudits alongside multiple awards and nominations on the horror film circuit. Stepping down from directing Derrickson and Boardman wrote the script for ""The Devil's Knot"" (2013), a crime drama with a satanic twist, directed by Atom Egoyan and starring Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon. Derrickson returned to directing with ""Deliver Us From Evil"" (2014) based on the book ""Beware the Night"" (2001). In June 2014 Derrickson was confirmed as director of ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) with Benedict Cumberbatch taking the title role."
Shane Black,"On his way to becoming one of the highest-paid screenwriters in motion picture history, Shane Black redefined the action movie by flipping its stale conventions upon its head while producing untold numbers of pale imitators. Black shot to the top of the class with his first script, ""Lethal Weapon"" (1987), which resuscitated the buddy cop genre on its way to becoming one of the biggest hits of the year. It also spawned three sequels over the next decade, but Black only had his hand in writing the original draft for ""Lethal Weapon 2"" (1989). Meanwhile, he landed a huge payday for his spec for ""The Last Boy Scout"" (1991) and became one of Hollywood's top-earning rewrite specialists, raking in a cool million per job. But nothing compared to the $4 million score he managed for ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996), especially in light of the action flick's subsequent failure at the box office. After taking nearly a decade off to throw some of Hollywood's most notorious parties, Black reemerged as the writer and director of ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" (2005), a hilarious and highly-entertaining action-comedy that unfortunately flopped at the box office, but nonetheless put him on sure footing for a solid comeback."
Spike Lee,"Spike Lee was an American director, writer, producer, and actor who was bar-none the pre-eminent chronicler of black life in America through the lens of independent film throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. Over a three decade-plus career, Lee's films, or ""joints"" as he often called them, were brazen cherry bombs aimed at mainstream society, tackling such thorny issues as racism, crime, poverty, media manipulation, and religion with style, grit, and urgency. Love him or hate him, Lee proved time and time again that you simply cannot discount him. Born Shelton Jackson Lee on March 20, 1957 in Atlanta, GA, Lee was raised in an artistically inclined, Afro-centric family. His mother, Jacqueline Carroll, was a professor of arts and black literature, while his father, William James Edward Lee III, was a jazz musician and composer, so it is perhaps no coincidence that Lee and all of his younger siblings would end up pursuing careers in the arts and taking part in his feature films: his brothers, David and Cinqué, grew up to become a photographer and an actor/filmmaker, respectively, while his sister, Joie, became a screenwriter, producer, and actress. After spending the first few years of his life in Georgia, Lee and his family moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he would spend his formative years. It was here that his mother nicknamed him ""Spike."" After attending John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, Lee enrolled in Morehouse College, a historically black university. While at Morehouse, Lee made his first student film, ""Last Hustle in Brooklyn"" (1977). He also took film courses at Clark Atlanta University, and eventually graduated from Morehouse with a B.A. in mass communication. Upon returning to NYC, Lee was accepted into the graduate film program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, where he earned a Master's degree in film & television. Lee's thesis film, ""Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads"" (1983) caused major waves, becoming the first student film to be showcased in Lincoln Center's prestigious New Directors/New Films Festival, and winning Lee the Student Academy Award. That same year, Lee founded his production company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, a portend of Lee's proclivity for provocation. In 1986, Lee released his debut feature, ""She's Gotta Have It"" (1986). Shot for a few thousand dollars in sultry black and white, and featuring a narrative device borrowed from Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Rashomon"" (1950), the film followed three young black men as they compared and contrasted their experiences dating the same woman. Critics were wowed by the film, and Lee was instantly pegged as a filmmaker to watch. His sophomore effort, ""School Daze"" (1988), was a dark comedy partially inspired by Lee's tenure at Morehouse College, which notably featured the first instance of what would become Lee's visual calling card, the so-called ""floating"" dolly shot. For his next film, Lee swung big, taking a look at one swelteringly hot day on one block in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bed-Stuy, as tensions between black residents and the white owners of a pizza joint reach a breaking point. ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989), was hailed as a masterpiece immediately upon its release, was a prime contender for the Palme d'Or at that year's Cannes Film Festival, and was predicted to be a major player in that year's Academy Awards. To the chagrin of many, ""Do the Right Thing"" was snubbed for a Best Picture nod, and Lee was shut out of the Best Director nominations, leaving him to make due with a Best Original Screenplay nomination. To add salt to the wound, Lee felt that that year's Best Picture winner, ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), was based on safe racial stereotypes meant to coddle white people. As the nineties began, Lee went in to full-on prolific auteur mode: he would release one film a year for the entire decade, except for 1993. First up was ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990), in which Denzel Washington played a troubled jazz musician loosely based on Lee's father, beginning a fruitful collaborative partnership with the leading man. Next up was the interracial romantic comedy ""Jungle Fever"" (1991) starring Wesley Snipes, followed by the sprawling biopic ""Malcolm X"" (1992), in which Washington turned in a powerhouse performance as the civil rights activist. Critics praised the film as Lee's best, and one of the best films of the decade, but once again, the Academy shut him out: no Best Picture or Best Director nominations (and Washington lost Best Actor to Al Pacino's hammy, scenery-chewing turn in ""Scent of a Woman"" (1992)). Lee took 1993 off to get married to lawyer Tonya Lewis. In response to yet another snub, Lee turned out a trio of middlingly-received pulpy crime dramas: ""Crooklyn"" (1994), ""Clockers"" (1995), and ""Girl 6"" (1996), before releasing another civil rights epic, ""Get on the Bus"" (1996). Lee followed this up with his first documentary, ""4 Little Girls"" (1997), a probing documentary on the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, AL. This earned Lee his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Documentary Feature. Lee's third collaboration with Washington, ""He Got Game"" (1998), was a sobering tale of black fatherhood and the escapism of basketball, while ""Summer of Sam"" (1999) was a bloated look at the tumultuous summer that overtook NYC in 1977. His first concert film ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" (2000), was better received than his next narrative film, ""Bamboozled"" (2000), a media satire shot for cheap on digital video about a modern televised minstrel show, which critics dismissed as impossibly broad and unrealistic (though today it looks prescient). Lee bounced back with another well-received documentary, ""Jim Brown: All-American"" (2002), as well as one of his most acclaimed narrative films, ""25th Hour"" (2002), in which he slyly transformed a tale of a convicted drug dealer (Edward Norton) experiencing his last day of freedom into a look at the post-9/11 grief and trauma that had engulfed all of New York City. In true Lee fashion, he then followed up one of his most acclaimed films with one of his most derided films, ""She Hate Me"" (2004), in which an enterprising young man starts a business impregnating wealthy lesbians. Critics savaged the film, and audiences stayed away. Luckily for Lee, the same could not be said for his next film, ""Inside Man"" (2006). A taught, socially conscious heist thriller starring Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and his longtime collaborator Washington, the film was a hit with both critics and audiences. ""When the Levees Broke"" (2006) was a sprawling, angry documentary look at the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, while the baffling WWII drama ""Miracle at St. Anna"" (2008) received perhaps the most scathing reviews of Lee's career. After revisiting the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina with the documentary ""If God Is Willing and da Creek Don't Rise"" (2010), and returning to his low-budget indie roots with the divisive coming of age drama ""Red Hook Summer"" (2012), Lee turned out a duo of ill-advised, underperforming genre film remakes: ""Oldboy"" (2013), a new take on Korean auteur Park Chan-wook's revenge saga, and ""Da Sweet Blood of Jesus"" (2014), based on Bill Gunn's hallucinatory, Afro-centric vampire romance, ""Ganja and Hess"" (1973). Lee got some of his groove back with ""Chi-Raq"" (2015), an ambitious update of the Classical Greek comedy ""Lysistrata"" set in modern-day Chicago, in which all of the characters spoke in rhyme. That same year, Lee was given an Academy Honorary Award for his contributions to film, usually a sign that an artist's glory days are behind themHowever, Lee proved he was still a vital force with his next film, ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018). Based on the true story of two police officers, one black (John David Washington, son of Denzel), and one white (Adam Driver) who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in 1970s Colorado Springs, the film told a highly entertaining story, while sucker punching audiences in it's final moments by drawing parallels to the current fraught political climate. Critics praised ""BlacKkKlansman"" as one of Lee's best, the film earned $90 million at the box office on a $15 million budget, and Lee was awarded the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Sweetest of all, however, was the fact that ""BlacKkKlansman"" finally earned Lee those elusive Oscar nods for Best Picture and Best Director."
Taika Waititi,"Kiwi filmmaker Taika Waititi's gift for uproarious and absurd humor served him well as director on such films as ""What We Do in the Shadows"" (2014), ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017), which freely mixed humor with horror, action-adventure and other genres. He was born Taika David Waititi in Raukokore, a settlement on New Zealand's North Island, on August 16, 1975. Raised in the country's capital city of Wellington by a Maori father and a Russian Jewish mother, Waititi initially planned to become a painter or a deepsea diver, but fell in love with acting after appearing in high school drama productions. While studying theater and film at Victoria University of Wellington, he also began performing as part of a comedy group, So You're a Man, which also included Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords. The group parted ways after several successful productions in 1996 and 1997, but Waititi and Clement would reunite as a new comedy act, the Humourbeasts, in 1999. The duo's show, ""The Untold Tales of Maui,"" proved exceptionally popular throughout New Zealand and earned them the Billy T. Award, given to up-and-coming New Zealand comedy talent, in 1999. The following year, Waititi co-starred in the dark comedy ""Scarfies"" (2000), which earned him an NZ Film Award nomination for his turn as a college student who becomes involved in a kidnapping plot. More supporting roles followed, including the road trip comedy ""Snakeskin"" (2001) and a male stripper on ""The Strip"" (TV3, 2002-2003). But he soon tired of playing broad sidekick roles, and made his debut as writer and director on the short ""John and Pogo"" (2002). He struck paydirt with his second effort, ""Two Cars, One Night"" (2004), a short about two boys and a girl in a parking lot that blossomed into an unexpectedly sweet fable. The film was a remarkable success on the festival and awards circuit, netting an Oscar nomination for Best Live Action short, among numerous other accolades. Waititi would direct several more shorts, including an early version of ""What We Do in Shadows"" (2005) with Clement, before making his feature debut with ""Eagle vs. Shark"" (2007). An offbeat romantic comedy with Clement and Loren Taylor as a pair of eccentrics who find love, the film won several festival awards, including Best Screenplay at the US Comedy Arts Festival, which in turn led to Waititi's inclusion on a list of ten ""directors to watch"" by Variety.. After helming a quartet of episodes of  ""Conchords"" (HBO, 2007-2009), he cemented that status with his next film, the comedy-drama ""Boy"" (2010), about an 11-year-old Maori boy whose elaborate fantasies about his ex-con father (played by Waititi) are tested when he turns up with members of his gang. A huge hit in New Zealand, it paved the way for a feature-length version of ""What We Do in Shadows"" (2014), a mockumentary-style comedy with Waititi, Clement and comic actor Jonny Brugh as mismatched vampires trying to co-exist in modern New Zealand. A cult favorite in the States and abroad, it later generated two spin-off series, including an American sitcom based on the film for the FX Network and co-produced by Waititi and Clement. Waititi's string of successes continued unbroken with his next film, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" (2014), with Sam Neill and Julian Dennison as an outdoorsman and his juvenile delinquent foster son, who become the subject of a manhunt. Though Waititi had expressed reticence in working on a major studio feature, he won over Marvel Studios with a demo reel he created for its upcoming Thor feature. The reel's tone - a mix of special effects-driven action clips and comedy - won over Marvel, which tapped him to direct ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017). Waititi's approach, which freely mixed broad comedy and superhero action, not only revived waning interest in the Thor franchise, but also provided Marvel with a hit that pleased diehard fans and casual viewers alike. The success of ""Ragnarok"" - it was the ninth highest-grossing film of 2017 - opened numerous doors for Waititi, who responded with a slew of new projects, including the dark fantasy ""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019), about a young German boy whose imaginary playmate is Adolf Hitler (played by Waititi), and a live-action version of the iconic anime film ""Akira"" (2021). On the television front, Waititi was tapped to direct an episode of Lucasfilm's ""The Mandalorian"" (Disney+, 2019- ), and a series version of Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits."""
Tom McCarthy,"Though actor Tom McCarthy began his career performing in front of the camera on notable features and television shows, he furthered his artistic ambitions as the director of acclaimed independent films like ""The Station Agent"" (2003) and ""The Visitor"" (2008), both of which earned considerable critical acclaim and award recognition. Prior to his turn to directing, McCarthy made a name for himself on stage, forming a noted comedy improv troupe in college before exploring the depths of Shakespeare in several productions. After cutting his teeth guest-starring on ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010), ""Spin City"" (ABC, 1996-2002), ""Ally McBeal"" (Fox, 1997-2002) and ""The Practice"" (ABC, 1997-2004), McCarthy had a memorable, but short-lived regular series role on ""Boston Public"" (Fox, 2000-04). But it was his first film, ""The Station Agent,"" which starred the 4'5"" actor Peter Dinklage, that propelled McCarthy's status, especially after the film was nominated for a number of critics and festival awards. By the time he directed his second film, ""The Visitor,"" which earned equal amounts of critical praise and award nominations, McCarthy was well on his way to developing a reputation as a versatile and talented artist. That view was confirmed when McCarthy's film ""Spotlight"" (2016) won Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards."
Yorgos Lanthimos,"Born in Athens, Greece in 1973, Yorgos Lanthimos briefly studied business and played professional basketball before he turned to study film in his hometown. Although there were very few Greek films being made, Lanthimos managed to find work behind the camera as a commercial director. He co-directed his first feature, a comedy called ""My Best Friend"" (2001), but the mainstream sensibility didn't suit his style. ""Kinetta"" (2005) was his first solo directing effort, and his unique style and framing earned the film entry into international festivals in Berlin and Toronto. His aesthetic was on full display in ""Dogtooth"" (2009), a drama about a family that has withdrawn from the outside world. The film earned the Un Certain Regard Award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Lanthimos' next film ""Alps"" (2011) wasn't met with the same regard, but his first English language film, ""The Lobster"" (2015), cemented his reputation as a wholly unique auteur. The film won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and Lanthimos was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His follow up, the thoughtful psychological thriller ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) starring Nicole Kidman didn't have as much success, but again Lanthimos bounced back with his most high profile project to date. ""The Favourite"" (2018) won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director."
Rodney Rothman,"Raised in Queens and Scarsdale, New York, Rodney Rothman began writing comedy bits in high school. He even went to to the length of going to Rockefeller Center to pass a joke to the writers of ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975-). The ploy was unsuccessful, but Rothman kept writing. He attended Middlebury College then landed a job as a junior writer on ""Late Show with David Letterman"" (CBS, 1993-2015) that lasted for five years and ended with Rothman as head writer and producer. Once he left the show, Rothman wrote an article for The New Yorker, which became controversial when it was revealed that he had fictionalized some of his story. The scandal didn't prevent him from landing a job as a writer on ""Undeclared"" (Fox, 2001-02) a comedy created by Judd Apatow and Paul Feig. The show never found an audience and was cancelled, which left Rothman bereft. He decided to retire at age 28. Or, at least, he decided to move to a retirement community and live there for a few months. He turned that experience into a Early Bird, a non-fiction book which caught the eye of executives at NBC, who went far enough to make a pilot for the show before deciding not to go forward. Retirement over, Rothman landed work as a writer on the comedy series ""Committed"" (NBC, 2005) then on the show ""Help Me Help You"" (ABC, 2006) starring Ted Danson. He made his feature film debut, contributing to the screenplay for ""Grudge Match"" (2013) starring Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro as retired rivals who are enticed to get back into the ring for one last fight. Rothman also wrote the successful sequel ""22 Jump Street"" (2014) before writing the script for ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018). Rothman also co-directed the animated film, which earned rave reviews and an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature."
